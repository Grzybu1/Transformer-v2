I can't just let Tom kill me.
I'm not that drunk.
It's my treat.
The author is Brazilian.
Have you bought a watermelon?
It's the sort of day when you'd like to stay in bed.
I'm going to take some pictures.
What do you say you join me for dinner?
People used to laugh at him behind his back.
These trousers need pressing.
The mayor denied having taken a bribe.
We still need your help.
Have I kept you waiting long?
I'm not the only person who couldn't do that.
My roommate complained about the noise.
Do your homework by yourself.
Stand up straight.
Can you remember the first time you ate at this restaurant?
She cannot have done such a thing.
What school did you go to?
That guy is off his rocker!
This changes nothing.
I just didn't want you to get hurt.
Do you really want me to help you?
I sympathize.
I'll give you a lift.
Is Tom OK?
I hate her parents.
Tom prefers not to talk about it.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
I might vote for you.
Tom is one of Mary's students.
Save it on the external hard drive.
They arrived too soon.
You should go now.
My father bought me a bicycle.
Tom cut the cake with the new knife Mary had given him.
We're not afraid of any difficulties.
She was making tea.
I think nobody's home.
Did you take the money?
Would it have been better if Tom hadn't been there?
I live in a small fishing village.
You don't have the right.
Do you think we should just wait and hope it changes?
Could we have a table in the non-smoking section?
That makes perfect sense to me.
I need the money.
Our son died during the war.
Tom started yelling.
We want you to take it.
I'll have to work hard.
Police think the fire was deliberately lit.
We're interfering.
Everyone is scared.
Could I talk to you in private?
She was late for the bus.
I'd be honored.
You ruined my life.
I'll stay here until ten.
I like westerns.
Don't underestimate me.
That was a good year.
The rain made me late.
She's innocent.
He resigned from his office.
Tom couldn't sleep last night.
Do you still not understand?
The author's name is familiar to us.
Did you buy these for me?
Do you have the painting?
Nothing could stop him.
I don't want to live with you anymore.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
She insulted him.
The storm blew down a tree.
We're better than they are.
I have no insurance.
I wrote a memo.
He is late.
Insects are arthropods.
Don't believe everything you hear.
He promised to marry her.
You're wasting both of our time.
I know that you won't be able to do that without some help.
That's a fake.
She has gone through many difficulties.
The bus is always crowded.
I'm going to work on that.
I think they like me.
We postponed the event.
I'd like to talk about your situation.
We're waiting for the right moment.
How long were you sick?
How much money did you spend in total?
She is very bitter toward me.
Fewer and fewer people are working to support more and more people living on government benefits.
It cost me 50 dollars to have my watch fixed.
Tom may not be wrong.
I need to stop.
It's easily done.
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
I just don't feel like it.
I was forced to resign.
I'll always remember you.
Did you put on sunscreen?
We forgot to lock the door.
I want you and me to be happy.
Don't you tell me to relax.
You should spend what little time you have left with your friends.
I had a job when I was your age.
Our guide knows the history of all these places.
I'm biased.
I'll handle it.
You're overworked.
I don't want to do that with you.
Tom became an engineer.
He will explain it to you when he comes back.
Tom was quite pleased with himself.
Tom told Mary to shut up.
Why are you always so happy?
I hope you brought an umbrella.
She heard him cry.
I've had a headache since yesterday.
Tom wasn't at all surprised.
I honestly think it's better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.
I thought you were serious.
Which team will win?
May I shave your sideburns?
I don't speak fast.
I don't like people looking at me.
I think they did it on purpose.
I was ashamed of what I had done to my benefactor.
We will visit them soon.
One of my favorite tunes was playing on the radio.
Tom was the one who taught me how to milk a goat.
Are you recording this?
I called him to the telephone.
Have you ever done any volunteer work?
Who am I? Where do I come from? Is there life after death? What is the meaning of life?
Where do you come from?
I contributed.
We can't go right now.
I feel homesick.
We had no choice but to call the police last night.
I can't hear anything because of the noise.
I let the cat out of the house.
How long does it take to go to the office from your home?
This problem is difficult to solve.
I prefer to write in French.
Tom confessed.
I wanted you to see that I'm not all that bad.
He had a traffic accident.
Who will provide capital for the venture?
You're all mine.
It'll be hard to persuade Tom.
It didn't take you long to get here.
I hope this is resolved quickly.
Why don't you trust me?
My throat's a little dry.
I feel the same way about it as you do.
What are they going to do?
Tom hardly ever wears a tie.
Could you tell us what happened next?
How many letters does the Russian alphabet have?
I wouldn't want anyone to see us.
I haven't seen any of his pictures.
He put the skis on top of the car.
I got lost in the forest.
I want to buy a dozen bananas.
My girlfriend is crying.
I want them to be your friends.
She came out on top.
I slept just two hours.
Are you the bank manager?
Where is the nearest police station?
Do you feel like a drink?
Tom still hasn't paid me.
That sounded like an explosion.
I just wanted to be sure.
There is a TV in this room.
Goat meat is tasty and can be prepared in different ways.
We know very little about the cause of this disease.
Never underestimate your audience.
Do you play in a band?
He speaks English with a German accent.
I was bored with his old jokes.
It was a very difficult story to write.
Don't post drunk pictures on Facebook or Twitter.
What did you eat?
I'll give you this camera.
You're all happy.
I was trying to lose weight.
It would seem that you know something that I don't.
He gave his children a good education.
He's got a boy-next-door look about him.
You'll never leave this town.
Don't stand next to the window.
Tom was obviously worried about what might happen.
How could you not know that?
It's not too late for you.
You need to fix it.
They have been busy.
The army has advanced to the river.
He neglected his duties.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
I've got to go to the hospital.
The sky is cloudy today.
This is private.
His smile put her at ease.
I understood the message.
Which program did you watch yesterday?
We couldn't make out what she wanted.
Do you deny it?
I don't believe my eyes.
I talk to myself.
She could not swim.
He still loves her.
She came back soon after five o'clock.
I'm very proud of all of you.
I was there the other day.
He described exactly what happened.
You need to lose weight.
The train lurched to a standstill.
He has only six months to live.
It's very important to us.
I hope it's over.
There is an apple on the table.
Birds usually wake up early in the morning.
I think it's unlikely that aliens similar to what we see in the movies have ever visited our planet.
They lived on farms or in small towns.
He says it's urgent.
You must let me handle this.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
I'll keep it in mind.
The nurse hit a blood vessel.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
The effect was immediate.
I'm not surprised that happened.
He wished he had more time.
What do you think about global warming?
Tom doesn't smile often.
Did I miss the turn?
Tom told Mary to go back home.
I bet stuff like this doesn't happen to Tom.
He became financially independent.
Tom says that's a lie.
That's what you deserve.
I never saw him again.
I want you to come somewhere with me.
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.
Everyone's out.
I knew Tom was a locksmith.
Tell us about your family.
We went to the caf that I told you about.
I'd like to know the rest of the story.
Tom showed Mary his stamp collection.
I have so much to say.
That's where the problem lies.
I wish it would stop raining before tomorrow.
Where did they learn this?
What makes you so sure that this won't happen again?
I didn't save the file.
Let's take a breather.
Newton saw an apple fall off a tree.
I'm not persuaded.
She has just finished washing dishes.
Your problem is you're easily distracted.
Is he done using the telephone?
Having a telephone helped her find more clients.
Thank you for telling me the truth.
Let's walk to the bookstore.
I'm going on vacation next week.
You're starting to bore me.
Will it rain tomorrow?
They abandoned their homeland.
I usually don't work here.
I think you're being a little too careful.
He's a little taller than you are.
I think I'm being followed.
Tom is the fattest person I know.
Tom and I are buddies.
Tom wasn't my husband at that time.
Let's begin at the beginning.
He was great.
You made the same mistake as last time.
You seem to have mistaken me for my older brother.
Let's ask the teacher.
He comes to see my son now and then.
I burned my hand with an iron.
We need to take this very seriously.
Are you ready?
We can open the windows.
He rarely gives up.
They demanded a salary increase.
My cousin is hooked on smack.
A mighty cheer burst from the crowd.
Speak your mind.
I eagerly await your decision.
How did we get into so much trouble?
Don't you feel guilty?
I really don't understand why you think that's a good idea.
What is this nonsense?
I want you to read this letter.
The children were fed first.
You don't know me at all.
I'll go get the proper forms.
It tastes very good.
I don't want to deviate from the plan.
Tom came home after midnight.
Did I give you enough time?
I was in way over my head.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
I had him fix my watch.
I'm just a regular office worker.
I was given this ticket.
You can't be happy all the time.
The worst is over.
He attained his goal.
I don't know who they are.
You should have been more careful with your health.
It is important to know your own limitations.
I hate doing that.
Push the door open.
Tom isn't wearing a red tie.
Life is fun.
I feel like another person.
I didn't want to bug you.
The children are scared.
You've been very kind to me.
Let's be reasonable.
The work has to be finished before noon.
You might have heard of me.
We'll see you again.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
Why is my sister so mean to me?
Michael Jackson has passed away.
What are we doing for lunch?
You're getting closer.
This is not enough.
That hasn't happened.
There was nothing I could do about it.
What's in the package?
This job isn't as easy as it looks.
Let's ponder that for a moment.
I need a bag.
I wish we could get out of here.
I want to know how he manages to make such good use of his time.
Could I have money for my piano lesson?
I know who lives in that house.
His house is surrounded by trees.
Those boots are Tom's.
I think that's correct.
Do you have plans for additional education?
We need to get going.
We're doing the wrong thing.
Tom doesn't really want me to help him.
He had the courage to expose the scandal.
Where did you meet my father?
You'll get used to it one day.
She is a beauty.
You handled that well.
Don't you talk back to me.
I wish I had your job.
It was a busy night.
Both Tom and Mary are left-handed.
You should take an umbrella with you this morning.
I want to do this the right way.
Europeans like to drink wine.
He borrowed the car from his friend.
Can Tom get a dog?
He understands physics.
Everything is fine.
I bought a pair of leather gloves.
We knew Tom would be late.
You don't know what you're doing.
I don't eat out very often.
May I use some of this paper?
Our army attacked the kingdom.
The twins smiled.
Tom pretended that he didn't see it.
I wrote where I was working.
Please don't let this happen again.
You need to exercise more.
I should've done that somewhere else.
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I hope you were able to buy everything you need.
I'm at your disposal.
I just want a little more time.
Atoms are in everything.
I know I can trust you.
He asked me who I was.
I could scarcely believe it.
He got more than he bargained for.
Have you been told where the meeting will be?
I put on my trousers.
Tom didn't want to go any further.
Tom didn't go to the hospital.
Let's hope we can avoid this problem in the future.
I've been silent for a long time.
