You're too old.
Best of luck to you.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
I'd say you did well.
I may be wrong.
How long does it take to your office from the airport?
You didn't seem to enjoy the concert very much.
I like to sit in the front of the bus.
Did you buy a car?
Mother bought me the book.
What do you want to tell us?
Why are you being weird?
I handled it.
I'm not the only one who got here early.
Break time's over.
Look at this.
We could die.
Tom didn't struggle.
Your answer is wrong.
My mother is crazy.
Can you teach me French?
What did he do during the holidays?
I have no questions.
The goods will be delivered free of charge.
Tom eats rice almost every day.
Tom doesn't believe a word of what Mary just said.
I just feel awful.
I'm looking forward to Christmas.
I've decided to tell the truth.
You don't have to tell me his name.
He lives somewhere around here.
I need it.
Do you know us?
You need to work faster.
Stay away from us.
It's not as big a problem as you think.
Was anybody in there?
She was on the verge of killing herself.
I hope you're well paid.
He stood behind his mother.
Rasputin had the whole Russian court under his spell.
A big earthquake occurred in India yesterday.
Did they find anything?
May I ask you to do me a favor?
Tom was one of the invited guests.
My sister is so annoying.
Don't change a thing.
I don't want to die.
Where did you go to school?
Tom ate my lunch.
Let's draw straws.
Can you see where I'm coming from?
All the eggs went bad.
Forty people can't fit in here.
It's a miracle you survived.
Have you ever eaten a banana pie?
Tom quit smoking.
Be respectful.
Why are you looking at me?
You can have someone do it for you.
Drink this juice.
I'm not convinced of that.
I'm not frightened of anything.
Who takes care of your children while you're at work?
You've got a pretty good memory.
I guess it shouldn't really matter.
He painted all the walls green.
What don't you have?
The suspect was hiding out in the mountains for three weeks.
She thinks it is a positive development.
How many were wounded?
The woman is ready.
Do you know Latin?
I've always wanted to meet Tom.
No one knew who did it.
My Internet connection isn't fast enough.
He did nothing wrong.
I know you want to make me happy.
The young woman's face became even redder.
I came here to tell you something important.
You'd better come.
She will surely be enjoying a hot bath at this hour.
What was it that brought you to me?
The ice will crack beneath our weight.
She is very beautiful.
I guess I could give it a shot.
Tom walked to the front of the room.
I feed my dog just before I eat dinner.
You're the best man for the job.
Is there anybody here you don't know?
My native language is French.
They're walking without shoes.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
They'll go shopping.
She's a bad liar.
We're on schedule.
They slept in the same bed.
I didn't want to surprise you.
The dog is white.
I will fight.
He happened to be there.
I hope you're well rested.
Everyone recognized his skill.
What a loss!
I'll complain if I want to.
Let's keep in touch with each other.
I'm going to join a demonstration.
Give me a bottle of wine.
He made sure nobody could see him.
Women love that.
I heard a scream.
Close the door after you when you leave the room.
Your phone is ringing again.
Tom can drive.
I believed you.
I thought we had a great relationship.
Order was restored.
I laughed so hard I almost cried.
Tom always drinks tea in the morning.
I know you have a girlfriend.
I'm sure Tom can win.
Why do you want a horse?
Coffee will be served after the meal.
A long train of camels was moving to the west.
I want you to handle it.
He is acquainted with the custom.
She has no fear.
She spends way too much time surfing the web.
I can't believe we're here.
It was the happiest time of my life.
No one is coming.
I did it without any problems.
I can deliver that to Tom.
Don't take it out on me.
You're very talented.
Are you saying no?
Step aside.
I'm trying to get my children back.
Find me a glass.
Thousands of foreigners visit Japan each year.
This is too hard.
"I am not tired. ""Neither am I."""
We all know what happened here.
You need to help me.
Can you help me on this one?
He had barely enough money to buy bread and milk.
Just tell me when you want to leave.
I like your style.
That is not a tiger.
Thanks for helping out.
I don't deserve this.
What did it feel like?
You can't just keep throwing your money away on this kind of thing.
I am not getting involved.
Tom didn't ask me for permission.
Didn't anyone tell you?
Bite your tongue.
I'm sure I'll be fine.
Tom isn't feeling well.
We're not fit.
Tom was getting agitated.
You'll have no choice.
Why do women hate you so much?
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
You're the one who trained me.
How are we doing for time?
Would you be happier if I stayed?
How high can you jump?
Nobody heard the bell ring.
We're concerned for your safety.
He went to Paris by car yesterday.
Arabic is written from right to left.
I thought the game was over.
You must do it quickly.
I need that as soon as possible.
I bought this yesterday.
I just want to be prepared.
You need to redecorate your room.
Everyone got something for Christmas.
We're resilient.
Can you account for all the money you spent?
He was accused of theft.
I was very happy about it.
You're cool.
Is it still raining?
The flood deposited a layer of mud.
Tom wasn't at home today.
"You're a good guitarist. ""I'd like to think I am."""
Nobody told me you were here.
You're famous.
Be proud of yourself.
Our negotiations broke off.
The library is on the second floor.
What kind of person do you think I am?
They told me about it.
Shouldn't this be in the refrigerator?
Grab as much as you need.
My fingers are so numb with cold that I can't play the piano.
It's raining again!
The crocodile trapped the gnu as it tried to cross the river.
They set out on a picnic.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
The heat kept me awake all night.
Don't be so angry.
We heard the boy playing the violin.
There's nowhere to hide.
There is no denying that she is very efficient.
I think it's time for me to leave for school.
Bill Gates is the world's richest man.
It has been raining since yesterday.
Tom is a grown man.
Dinner was awesome.
The police can't arrest you.
She was similar to me in many ways.
Can they see me?
Tom won't believe it.
Maybe we can fix this.
Where did you spend your holidays?
He finds fault with everything I say.
We need not have hurried.
Tom forgot to file his taxes.
Your drinking is starting to affect the performance of your duties.
I'm kidding.
Is Japanese taught in your school now?
I sometimes have trouble remembering things.
I have to go to the men's room.
What's your best price?
The government watched the activities of radical groups carefully.
He is a man of his word.
Are you blaming me for your lack of success?
I just feel a little inadequate.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
Now let's get down to work.
Do you like music?
You've got a vivid imagination!
I have misjudged you.
Who gave the command?
I won't close the door.
Can you save Tom?
I don't see how that would help.
You need to be prepared.
I won't take your money.
Try it again.
The post office is closed.
Hang on a bit until I'm ready.
I know what they're paying you.
This beer is for you.
You can't give up.
I assumed you would come.
I'd be happy to discuss it.
How deep is this river?
Tom kept his opinion to himself.
My grades have improved significantly.
I can't place him.
Are you falling in love with me?
Why don't we call it a night?
The experiment has to begin.
Don't touch it.
That's not an option.
I'm angry.
I am tired of listening to his long speech.
Tom swam to the shore.
It feels very similar to this one.
What time did you get home?
I'm a busy person.
You've come too early.
You should mind your own business.
I was shocked to see this.
I really don't want to talk about it.
He told me that he would visit Nara next month.
Something embarrassing happened last week.
Are you finished with your work?
She used to play tennis every Sunday.
I thought you were in charge.
How long were you gone?
You shouldn't prejudge people.
I know where Tom lives.
I hadn't planned to tell you.
They paid separately.
Would that make you happy?
The soldiers opened fire.
I think I'm getting sick.
Do you want to stay here all night?
I object to her going there alone.
It's good to get up early in the morning.
I really don't have anything else to say.
Tell me what you have in your hand.
I know I can't be replaced.
I'm afraid of nothing.
I don't really need this.
Take a look around you.
My motorcycle broke down on the way.
I was too tired to walk any more.
He applied for the job and got it.
You're very wise.
Turn right there.
My mother can't ride a bicycle.
We need to discuss this.
Tom says that he never dreams.
What horrible weather!
There's something you have to know.
I was about to call you.
Please make yourself comfortable.
Don't change your mind so often.
I wasn't kidding.
He has a habit of keeping the door open.
You should keep your promise.
You probably just want to be alone.
There is something wrong with my car.
You left the iron on.
I was very patient.
I'm afraid to go.
I can't put up with her any longer.
That is our school.
No one was hit.
I think a movie is more entertaining than any book.
I don't see what we can do.
The high court decided to try the fugitive warlord in abstentia.
Don't ask too many questions.
We debated on the question of world population.
I don't want you to do what I did.
You're such a wimp.
The most amazing thing happened yesterday.
Do you want to try it?
She has known him for a long time.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
Tom kept Mary waiting for a long time.
I want to please you.
The goods arrived undamaged.
Go on without me.
I lost control.
That's a good idea.
Humans aren't the only animals that use tools.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
Where is the toilet?
We found a secret door into the building.
You look a little young to be a teacher.
Tom never asked me.
You have a really good sense of direction.
Take your shoes off.
I can't believe I missed this before.
I should get back home.
The house was more expensive than I had expected.
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
I'll never forget that.
I'd like you to see this.
I've just seen Tom.
Is that ring made of real gold?
You should've told Tom that a long time ago.
Did you find anything?
I forgot to tell you my phone number.
We depend on you.
Tom was afraid that no one would show up for the party.
Thank you for your trouble.
We should wait a little.
Tom is driving me nuts.
We just arrived at the station.
All three of us are students.
Many of the prisoners were decapitated.
Where are all our suitcases?
Where do they come from?
She spends a major part of her income on food.
Are you registered?
I don't think I said that.
I bought a new sewing machine.
Never tell lies.
The wedding ceremony will be held regardless of the weather.
Tom said he didn't have time to answer all of my questions.
What're you doing here?
We've made too many bad decisions.
I can't believe I used to watch this show.
They were all actors.
Will there ever be world peace?
A man with a big dog came in.
The boy is very honest.
Maybe we should just give up.
No proof was ever found.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
We were both very tired.
I got it.
Fasten your seat belt.
I was too scared to do anything.
I found a pair of sunglasses by the swimming pool.
I intended to study medicine in America.
I want to sleep a little longer.
Tom doesn't use sunscreen.
There you go again.
He has many history books.
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?
Dance with me.
Where is the bus terminal?
I confessed to stealing the money.
I think this will do nicely.
I just wanted to listen to some music.
We know all about you.
All that has changed.
I thought it might be better to tell you now instead of later.
He rushed out of the office.
His son died last year.
It's going to get ugly.
Both were extremely rich.
Tom instantly fell in love with Mary.
He drinks too much beer.
It's difficult to help people who don't believe they need help.
There was a mad rush toward the exit.
I think we're all a bit crazy.
I'm famous.
Those are your choices.
The egg is a universal symbol of life and rebirth.
This is not necessary.
What time do you go to bed?
I walked three-fourths of a mile.
I lost my glasses.
Don't ask me for money.
Get away from me.
Is it easy to install?
I still think about her from time to time.
People live only about 70 years.
I'm a bit nervous right now.
This dog is yours.
I never said that I wanted that.
How would you fix it?
Do you think I should do this?
Did you practice the piano this morning?
Tom isn't a good electrician.
Can we speak French?
I ironed the handkerchief.
You can't back out.
What are they made of?
Give me some more tea.
Animals are our friends.
We keep having the same old problem of people not paying their bills on time.
Get some sleep.
They accused me of being a liar.
Do you have a license to fly a plane?
You have as much right as everyone else.
He's a law-abiding citizen.
I think we should stick together.
The tiger was killed.
Do you enjoy losing?
Tom never wanted to be lawyer.
I am going to play soccer after school.
I can't figure out how to operate this machine.
I wanted to have a beer with you.
I really want to leave.
I rescheduled.
Tom and Mary are playing chess.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
I want to see how it ends.
Apples are red.
I didn't want to scare you.
Can't you understand that it's impossible?
Tom was apparently murdered while he was sleeping.
I think what Tom is doing is worthwhile.
I cannot do without this book.
His sudden appearance surprised us all.
I don't understand what he wants.
He fell in love with her at first sight.
The book is now ready for publication.
They're all watching TV.
She used the car to go to the office.
Tom had a smile on his face.
I thought I heard you.
This cow is not branded.
I know Tom is a little late.
The boat is on fire.
It took all day.
She committed suicide yesterday.
She will come if you ask her.
Where did you go for spring break?
Do you have any travelers' checks?
It used to be that a girl could only marry if she had a dowry.
Why would they do that?
Being aware of what and how much we eat is essential to good health.
You sound tired.
I don't think I passed the test.
I can drive a car.
What time do you usually eat breakfast?
Move away from me.
I need to know who you are.
I need some help here.
It's a waste of time.
Can we do that here?
I hope this good weather continues.
The treaty did not ban nuclear tests under the ground.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Listen to me carefully.
She so wants to go.
Did you have fun last night?
Am I making sense?
We can't let you do that.
I didn't mean to make Tom cry.
My dog is pregnant.
I don't like to eat garlic in the morning.
I'm glad I don't have your job.
He came to school even though he was unwell.
I think you went too far.
I really appreciate you helping me.
It's an excellent solution.
Tom seems to want to help Mary.
He went to Paris at the end of May.
It takes time to develop political awareness.
You're overemotional.
They were all here.
He is blind in one eye.
Tom says he saw a ghost.
You look good in that suit.
The room is empty.
These books are Tom's.
What are you trying to say?
You don't have any proof.
You really must see that movie.
The population of Shanghai is as large as that of Tokyo.
There can be only one explanation for that.
Will you help me clean the room?
You are the one.
He will always be with you.
Where did you meet my father?
Did you show it to your parents?
I'd like to earn my keep while I'm staying with you.
What are you doing this evening?
What's your age?
May I smoke here?
Get on a horse.
You have to allow for the boy's age.
He couldn't wait to try out his new surfboard.
I never drink tea with milk.
You've gone too far.
Are you questioning my judgment?
Tom is aggressive.
Keep out of sight.
She did her best to help him.
I want to punch you in the face.
Do you want to tell me what this is?
It's very good.
Are you hurt?
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
I'm glad Tom was there with me.
"What were you two talking about? ""Nothing."""
I can't repair the computer.
I can't believe it's really you.
Help yourself to the cake.
Do you remember anything else?
Tom is having a heart attack.
It was a compromise.
The man was hiding in a dense forest.
Don't try to carry too much.
Maybe I'll buy a bike.
I think I know why.
You're stuck.
Tom would never let you drive.
When will your new novel come out?
Christmas is a magical time of the year.
I've been busy.
I let go of the rope.
I can't show up looking like I've been working on the farm all day.
I've always thought that.
Some people are just weird.
There is a rotating restaurant at the top of this tower.
Tom's suffocating.
That's all I care about.
Stay here.
Tom should be back before 2:30.
They were surprised by what they saw.
She needs our help.
I'm in love.
I'm here to talk about Tom.
Tom told me that Mary was dead.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
The rain made me late.
Tom doesn't know that I won't do that.
I don't know much about computers.
What do you advise?
This is incredible.
Write down your date of birth here.
My brother is three years younger than I am.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
I have no proof of that.
I won't run away like a coward.
That is a blue house.
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
You can't smoke here.
I heard that she came here.
He's about to go.
I didn't want to waste so much time.
We can't see it.
I'm not as young as I used to be.
Are you bored?
His failure taught me a good lesson.
The servant swept the floor.
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
Stop yelling in my ear.
You're no saint.
He made the children laugh.
My brother did it on my behalf.
Hurry up or you'll be late.
Give me the wine.
That's what I like about you.
Lend me a hand.
I can't put up with the way he spits.
Tom will never give up.
He spoke with a pipe in his mouth.
Tom was up all night.
Good luck to you!
I'm drunk.
Tom's dog isn't allowed in the house.
Why did you help Tom escape?
It was just a fling.
It may be unwise of you to advertise your presence.
We can pay.
Nobody wants to do that.
I didn't read the newspaper this morning.
I need caffeine.
It was his bicycle that was stolen.
They explored the Antarctic.
Tom will be here in a minute.
She is no longer what she used to be.
I would like to know how these substances are absorbed by the body.
You're too old for me.
Please insert a coin.
I can't believe Tom did that.
He is afraid of his father.
Mary is a wedding planner.
No one could solve the puzzle.
I don't want to offend you.
Am I fat?
I found it necessary to ask for help.
It sounds good to me.
Are they all ready?
We are brothers.
Please turn on the light.
I have a few gray hairs already.
Am I allowed to use this?
I can't force you to do anything.
Did you call the police?
You have work to do.
It's shameful to treat a child so cruelly.
You've got three weeks.
I'm smarter than you.
She was hungry enough to eat anything.
Have another drink.
They're afraid of me.
The police want to question you.
I'm going to be ready for that.
The President refused to answer the question.
What's the matter with you?
Thanks for bringing me up to date on this matter.
I've never had a problem with this car.
Do you have the train schedule?
It's time to do it.
Am I making myself clear?
I couldn't help yawning.
Be yourself.
He cannot have said so.
A bunch of people died in the explosion.
He apologized to her for being late.
You are wearing your shirt inside out.
It's a dead giveaway.
Today's show is a rerun.
There's a restaurant here.
I insist that we do this now.
That's a lot to consider.
Strong winds accompanied the rain.
A river flows through the valley.
I built this for you.
After you.
The baby's name was Tom.
Where's the nearest church?
She went out without saying a word.
I know why Tom doesn't want to dance.
I've warned you before about this.
I'm not good at negotiating.
Your brother is asking for help.
I know where Tom hides the key.
She has gone shopping.
Come immediately.
My dad is very strict.
I have to be punished.
The old man was run over and immediately taken to hospital.
I've told you that a hundred times.
Don't try to fool me.
How do you interpret this poem?
Don't get off while the vehicle is in motion.
She didn't know what to say to him.
He claimed to be an expert in finance.
I had a good coach.
Your work has greatly improved.
I think it's sad to have no friends.
They were high school sweethearts.
I'll try to fix it later.
It makes me feel dirty.
We'll see what they want.
That couldn't happen.
You can wait for me here.
I beat him at golf.
I'm so drunk now that I'm seeing two keyboards.
The office is empty.
You're going to be a father.
They had to find the strongest candidate possible.
How do you intend to do that?
How much is the car you are planning to buy?
We've had a lot of rain this year.
We're quitting.
I don't like visiting big cities.
I don't want to live with you anymore.
I can't go to the beach with you this weekend.
That's how it is.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
He is introverted.
Tom has achieved his goals.
I made a list.
The locals are very hospitable.
He speaks French fluently.
We're late because of you.
We're getting nowhere with those problems.
I knew Tom knew who was going to do that.
I'll visit you sometime in the near future.
Is your mom home?
I don't think I can leave early.
I think Tom is sad.
Can you verify that this message came from Tom?
He had the ambition to be prime minister.
That's not something I want to do.
I need to know what you saw that night.
We do everything together.
Give me a piece of paper.
Her doll was run over by a car.
It is wrong to steal.
I'll be free next Sunday.
I hope you're not alone.
Tom understands.
That isn't exactly what I said.
I've never tried doing it that way.
It's impossible to live on that island.
Is it already open?
I love you.
How much is your hourly pay?
You're very curious.
Tom wants his children to learn French.
Can they give you something for that?
I need to warn my mom.
He could not send his son to school.
Should I open the windows?
Where is the coffee shop?
Never forget to put out the fire.
I was hurt by many people.
There's a good view of Mt. Akagi from upstairs.
Just try it out.
This road is terrible.
You're a hundred percent right.
I will translate.
I couldn't understand a single word of what they said.
What can I tell Tom?
Drinks are on me.
I think I'm in trouble.
Who are you trying to impress?
She has no shame.
Is Tom aware of what he did?
The boy got scolded.
They are engaged in cancer research.
Is that another joke?
I usually drink a lot of milk.
How often do you check your messages?
I think we still have plenty of time.
Let's take a look at this.
Do you have one that is a little smaller?
Tom wants to start from scratch.
I hate to see you so miserable.
I'm strong enough.
We offer low-cost prefabricated houses.
How long are you going to stay?
Let's have a good time.
I don't spend much time studying French.
I learned a lot this weekend.
He was never to see his native land again.
Will it rain today?
Let's look under the bed.
Tom has two siblings.
They'll take care of you.
They'll kill you.
Can you at least be happy for me?
Do you ever sleep?
You make me sick.
Nobody ever laughs at my jokes.
He finally bent to my wishes.
I want to join your group.
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
The door is locked at nine every night.
They all entered.
A fire broke out last night.
Why are they doing this to me?
I hear you are good at cooking.
I'm glad I left Boston.
You may go there.
Can I ask you a quick question?
It was a very delicate negotiation.
The stock market crash of October 1987 in New York is still vividly remembered.
I just can't figure it out.
I was pleasantly surprised.
Five years have gone by since my father died.
There's really nothing more we can do.
We talked.
Drink less and sleep more.
I want to kiss you.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
Tom took a quick shower.
She touched him on the shoulder.
I've never tried riding a unicycle.
I'm sure your intentions were good.
I had my hair cut at the barber shop yesterday.
He made a little statue out of soft clay.
I want a second chance.
You're going to laugh.
Tom lived the high life until the money ran out.
It doesn't have to be like this.
Please refer to the owner's manual for more details.
I'm here with a friend.
I cried all night long.
I made a copy.
Sorry to disturb you.
Don't make abrupt moves.
I paid five dollars to him.
It's very sticky.
I'd much rather go by myself.
The meeting has already begun.
I received your note.
He was very fun.
The baby was quiet all night.
I wanted you to be proud of me.
This highway saves us a lot of time.
Just do your job.
I think Tom is a nice name.
The room has two windows.
They want us to come in right away.
Is French difficult?
I'm drinking a beer.
My father is very much involved in the stock market now.
I warned you not to come here.
I need his name.
Could you please tell me again when the meeting is supposed to start?
What does it look like?
I need some get-up-and-go.
Our electric heater does not work well.
They are looking to you for help.
He struck a match.
I need to finish writing my speech.
The coach made us run three extra laps.
We're so proud of you!
My secretary said it was urgent.
He was right the first time.
People always ask me why I do what I do.
You were always very kind.
You'd better take care of it.
Would you mind if I drank the rest of the milk?
We have to get you to a hospital.
What's the weight of your suitcase?
Get a hold of yourself.
He has a sharp tongue.
I didn't want to go to bed.
I won't back down.
He is likely to come.
You're very astute.
Tom can barely speak French.
Where were you? We've been looking all over for you.
We want to reach a wider audience.
Do you think Tom is conceited?
I'll spend the night here.
Did you grow up in Boston?
Electronic components can be cleaned using pure isopropyl alcohol.
All the things I bought have already arrived.
Can you answer this?
She was fined 10 dollars for that.
I've known about this for years.
We should've stayed with Tom.
I got dumped.
I revealed the truth of the matter.
A lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn't have done that.
This chair is Tom's.
A burnt child dreads the fire.
What season do you like the best?
There is a book on the desk.
The sun has not risen yet.
Did anybody else see it?
He started swearing.
You still haven't told me when you get off work.
What am I supposed to do with them?
How many guards were there?
I'm not going to talk anymore.
I was a fool to trust you.
That's old news.
He is a genius.
Stay very still.
Tom behaved badly.
Let go of my arm!
I had my car filled up at the service station at the corner.
I'll do whatever I can to help you.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
I'll give you a good piece of advice.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
Teachers should never make fun of students who make mistakes.
She was more beautiful than all the others.
He refused to take the bribe.
How much thinner do you want to be?
We need an answer.
Have your paper on my desk by Monday.
The leak needs to be stopped immediately.
I'd rather be hanged than shot.
It's a matter of personal taste.
"Where's your book? ""On the table."""
I don't want you to see me naked.
Walk with us.
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
The damage is done.
What's the right thing to do?
I have only half as many books as he does.
I like wearing old clothes.
Would you like another cup of tea?
Take care of your back.
I suppose you want me to pay for this.
Keep driving.
Saying and doing are two different things.
I thought they were unemployed.
Don't tell me you can't swim.
We got stuck in traffic.
Can you tell me what this symbol means?
It's dangerous.
The police are looking for you.
Tom sat on the window sill.
She was as thin as a rail.
Somebody told me that today's test was identical to the one we had last year.
The apple does not fall far from the tree.
I'm sure Tom will know how to do it.
You have to be here at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
What's the commotion?
Do you mind if I open the window and let the smoke out?
I'm looking for my key.
The news spread like wildfire.
Was it good?
I went to sleep as soon as I got home.
I hope you won't be too disappointed.
I had to make a choice.
Would you mind giving me a little help with some problems I'm having?
There were flies everywhere.
Why can't animals talk?
Is there a hotel around here?
I want to serve my country.
Tom thought Mary had died.
Where is my pencil?
She is fond of cake.
I don't really know why.
I want you to be here when I get back.
Who told you to bring me here?
What is the total number of students?
Tom said that Mary looked exhausted.
We came back to camp before dark.
I had to give it a shot.
I can't find my bag.
Is there a point?
Job security became a major worry.
Are you free in the afternoon?
His way of thinking is very childish.
Hurry up! We're late.
You can't believe a word of it.
Why don't you sing for us?
Our problem is how to get in touch with him.
We're like family.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
You can't leave.
I have to go back to work.
I know you've been trying to help.
Whales feed on small fish.
Is he dead?
I want you to take this with you.
Where have you been all afternoon?
Anything you're good at contributes to happiness.
Who's your favorite poet?
I'm sick of you.
You knew the answer all along.
I was very jealous.
Did your mother make those?
She writes to her son every so often.
You just need a change of scenery.
Everything has been arranged.
He's very ill.
I usually do the dishes.
Would you be willing to send me a sample free of charge?
He will be here today.
I'll help you look for Tom.
That girl looks boyish.
I really am busy.
My strength is all gone.
You shouldn't trust Tom.
Where was Tom tortured?
What's your favorite kind of candy?
I know very little about him.
How good are you?
I want my children to have the best of everything.
I'll be with you in a sec.
The squirrel climbed the tree.
They teased the new student.
I didn't recognize Tom.
No one saw us.
I told you I need a few more days.
Tom could have told me the truth.
I'm taking a walk in a park.
I trust we're all alone.
Hold this while I tie my shoes.
Where do you usually park?
All the kids at school made fun of me because I was fat.
That is sold at hardware stores.
I'll study your report.
I can do it by myself.
I liked your friends.
You're very angry.
What did you do yesterday?
Are you sure you aren't cold?
No one speaks with me.
This is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
It seems he's still alive.
Tom wanted to eat spaghetti.
You've got my sunglasses and I want them back.
I want you to go home.
French is a very beautiful language.
I was surprised by what I learned.
Are you sure about this?
See things as they are.
What woke you up?
I promise I'll be quiet.
I weigh about 60 kilos.
I met your son yesterday and he greeted me politely.
I know that I'm not alone.
My credit cards are maxed out.
I don't drink alcohol.
Is he still here?
I'm breast-feeding my baby.
I'd suggest the following change.
I value our friendship more than anything.
I'm looking for an ATM.
Tom is a bit short for his age.
He cried as if he were a boy of six.
Trust no one.
You should go back there.
Whose is this bicycle?
It was sweet of you to do this for us.
I can do nothing to help.
The whole nation wants peace.
My fuel line broke.
Let's enjoy the long vacation.
I'm relieved that you're safe.
You are our one millionth customer.
She looked away.
The water is rising.
He was every inch a king.
You're probably too young to understand what is likely to happen next.
What did you get for Christmas?
There's a lot to do.
I can't tell you how many times I've been there.
You can't stay in here all day.
Tom was proud of you.
You get out only what you put in.
I think that girl's name is Mary.
Give me the money you owe me and I'll be gone.
You can't trust computer translation.
Only time will tell you if you're right.
He has a heart of gold.
They'll go shopping.
Trying to convince Tom will be a waste of time.
Let's talk about why you want to do that.
I knew you'd have a good time.
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
Are you sure this is what you want?
We're taking over.
This elevator's capacity is ten people.
They would like to stay at home.
Take a picture with your phone.
Make it smaller.
Shut the door.
Money is everything.
What time does the concert start?
Tom's behavior has changed.
I wanted to buy you something nice.
Everyone was horrified.
I agree with his idea.
I wish that Tom was here to help us.
I lost sight of my friends.
Why don't you go take a nap?
How many people are in your crew?
I'd like to tell you something in private.
He may be a genius.
We know you're not stupid.
I can do it.
I know your name.
I can't carry this suitcase. It's too heavy.
I just assumed you'd be here.
Let's not be enemies.
I'm calling to see if you'd be interested in going to Boston with me next week.
What's your favorite color for carpets?
The noise was so loud that it was a nuisance to the neighbors.
I don't like the way he talks.
I have many things to do now.
I'd like to see you in my office.
I think you had better take a rest.
That's the last thing I want to do.
How did you know I was going to say yes?
It is more blessed to give than to receive.
We need to get you to a hospital.
Are you still on a diet?
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
We were together.
I don't take orders from you.
Does that mean something to you?
It might rain before evening.
It's so difficult that I've decided to give up trying.
I won't tell you why I did that.
Is there a train station near here?
She's only interested in fish and cockroaches.
Where did you get your hair cut?
She seems to have a tendency to exaggerate things.
He's a slob.
They treated us like family.
That river is dangerous to swim in.
Choose the color you like the best.
Are you on any medication right now?
I was framed.
He is always willing to help others.
You have to disappear.
Did you understand me?
It is high time you spilled the beans.
The chairperson has been associated with the organization for ten years.
A teacher should never make fun of a student who makes a mistake.
I'm not your father.
Can you help me carry this?
I regret becoming a teacher.
I'm still in love with Mary.
How's your kid doing?
You've done the best you can do.
Do you think Tom will die?
Many attended his funeral.
He used to drink.
What're you doing here?
She was advised by him to get more exercise.
There were no radios in Japan in those days.
Do you have the schedule?
Something unusual happened last night.
I did that for a long time.
Turn the radio down a little.
They did not keep their word.
It's a waste.
His helplessness appeals to her motherly sympathy.
Do you have a pen?
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
I worked hard.
I don't live far from the school.
Look around you.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
They're looking for you.
Your mother and father are dead.
I was worried for nothing.
Here is your appointment card.
You must be very busy these days.
Your lips are blue.
Are you having any trouble breathing?
We're starving.
Do you know the difference?
No one is perfect.
I think you ought to pay more attention in class.
We can't help Tom now.
Is that a new car?
We train together.
You ruined everything.
The poor people were at the mercy of the cruel dictator.
Tom worked until 2:30.
Are you the one who saved me?
I didn't go to the funeral.
I will return the book as soon as I can.
He likes to just sit around and play video games all day.
It's a short textbook for beginners.
I'm very busy.
I stop here to eat once or twice a week.
Why don't you tell me why you think it happened?
I bet you didn't know that.
Classes start on Monday.
You don't seem very pleased.
You look like you're busy.
You stick out like a sore thumb.
I'd like to talk about it.
You don't need to wait.
I came here to tell you what I found out.
She read the poem out loud.
You've got my helmet.
I hope you'll come.
Why do cosmetics have an expiration date?
Are you from around here?
I just can't wait to go to school.
It makes sense.
What did it look like?
Tom isn't crying.
I hope we don't have to wait for too long.
I still live at my dad's place.
A gunshot was heard in the distance.
I got lost and had a hard time finding my way back to the hotel.
They admired the lovely scenery.
Who won the contest?
Is there anything else to eat?
I like castles.
She gave me access to her records.
I decided to go out and explore the town.
Can you answer this riddle?
She eyed the stranger suspiciously.
She writes to him every week.
He got ready for departure.
It blew my mind.
Textbooks are expensive.
Tom always speaks in French.
I think you mentioned that last week.
Where's your school?
You said you were happy.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Whose idea was it to pitch the tent here?
I didn't know.
Do you want to join them?
He argues that the administration must look for alternative sources of revenue.
I'm offended.
He picked up the phone.
My apartment is more comfortable than yours.
Do you want to tell me what this is?
What an attractive woman!
Tom is at Mary's home.
It was nice talking to you.
I don't think I can eat this.
The boy threw a paper airplane at the teacher.
Can you excuse me a moment?
What are you doing buying a house that expensive?
Tom fastened his seat belt.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
They say that I'm an old woman.
You should help your father.
I wanted you to be proud of me.
My hobby is reading.
It was a stupid idea.
I'd like to help you get what you need.
Don't get the wrong idea.
He denied everything.
This one is special.
I think he ate about 10 oysters.
I think it's all right now.
Do you really want to know?
Go to the store.
He is not running in the coming election.
He's three years older than her.
He was born in a small town in Italy.
He had dinner by himself.
I'm a bank clerk.
I felt embarrassed at first.
Kyoto is visited by many tourists.
The assignment is due two weeks from today.
Be a good boy.
I admit I was surprised.
I feel like I'm going to be OK.
Turn off the lights.
How are you now?
You could have been happy.
What choices do we have?
The garbage collector comes three times a week.
I didn't know anyone was there.
Let us out.
Would you like some more bread?
We need authorization.
It seems those two are made for each other.
Tom was proud of you.
She will try it.
The weather has been good until today.
Whose pencil is this?
Speak for yourself.
It was one of the great discoveries in science.
I'm not like other people.
She drives me crazy.
I don't know what to do about it.
Coming here was a mistake.
She isn't old enough to get a driver's license.
This is absolutely wonderful.
I was exhausted from work.
Your dinner is getting cold.
I stopped laughing.
There's no more time.
That is the picture that he painted.
That's why I'm telling you not to go alone.
This will be a great opportunity.
He owns a dishwasher.
Leave out this word.
You're not helping me.
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
This is revolting.
He never speaks unless spoken to.
I think you need to buy a new pair of hiking boots.
I'm breaking up with my girlfriend tonight.
Tom denied that he had stolen anything.
Are you hiding something from us?
I don't know what we're talking about.
I can barely stand up.
"Don't enter the room until I say ""All right."""
Is that a problem?
I'll do anything you ask.
The school is closed.
This is all I know.
There was an explosion.
Don't you think it a bad thing?
You have to work faster.
I converted my yen into dollars.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I'll stay here until ten.
Careful driving prevents accidents.
We were right.
It's too bright.
Tom's boss is very demanding.
You may catch sight of our house from the train.
This fruit has an unpleasant smell.
I suppose that's why you don't like me so much.
You're telling lies again.
His supervisor gave him a sterling recommendation.
I really miss my girlfriend.
I just spent over three thousand dollars.
I'm blessed.
What is it that bothers you?
Tom is a daydreamer.
I'm sick of your excuses.
He gave back all the money he had borrowed.
The plane flew over the mountain.
Our little girl is growing up.
I was pretty relaxed.
You've got to help them.
She repulses him.
Is there someone here who speaks French?
He had the last laugh.
I wish that I could do more to help.
They visited us.
You're getting closer.
I wish I had followed the doctor's advice.
Don't throw away this magazine. I haven't read it yet.
This is a dead-end street.
Don't take it personally.
Do you like rock and roll?
I would like to see it.
You're not the only one that was hurt.
The top is turning clockwise.
My cat is following me.
I thought you'd changed.
Men talk about women all the time.
She can play the piano well.
That's why we want you.
I saw him three years ago.
A guard's been killed.
I didn't touch anything.
Tom caused this.
What is your greatest source of inspiration?
I've been trying to get your attention.
How much more work do you have?
Tom is just an ordinary man.
My father would never allow me to go out with someone like you.
I cringed.
Allied forces were attacking from the west.
I get up around seven.
He'll succeed for sure.
Please feed the dog every day.
Do you want to go?
Thanks for your contribution.
We all deserve a chance.
Tom lives on a private island.
I really like him.
Don't you think that's probably a good thing?
She advised him to talk about his life in the United States.
I like this neighborhood.
I think you're drunk.
I never visit my sister.
I think it's very dangerous.
We discussed the article I published.
Give him a break!
I said some things I wish I didn't.
You'd do the same for me.
I have to do the same thing.
My son can already count up to one hundred.
It's a stupid tradition.
Tom goes to school by bicycle.
I'm heading home.
I thought we had a deal.
It wasn't my intention.
You are not supposed to smoke at school.
Look who's back.
You can adjust the seat height by moving the adjustment lever up.
I was born on a ship.
You can't hold that against me.
Give me a hug.
I'd like you to meet him.
You will always be welcome.
Many cancer patients lose their hair because of the chemotherapy.
I'm sorry about your loss.
He was killed in a railroad accident.
Who's coming for dinner?
I will send it by email this afternoon.
I hate all of them.
A girl with blonde hair came to see you.
I can't stand this heat.
Your effort will surely bear fruit.
Have you already settled the bill?
I had a revelation.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
I want to see you in my office this afternoon.
I had a headache.
He pushed me gently.
I am a stranger here.
What did you hear?
We're sorry.
You should have told me a long time ago.
Preventive measures are much more effective than the actual treatment.
I am interested in music.
How long did you stay in Boston?
I'll call you after lunch.
I don't need a gun.
I'm going to have to call you back.
I'll paint the house.
Tom had a skiing accident.
Tom makes his own bread.
Why is Tom acting like this?
Don't tell anyone.
Would you tell me when to get off?
You don't seem very satisfied.
Tom never learned how to drive.
Would you please wait for a few minutes?
I'm sure you'll tell me what I want to know.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Do you travel often?
Where will you be?
Do you ask every new employee that question?
I work with him.
Where in Australia are you from?
Adjust the brakes.
It's not too late for you.
I don't like it any more than you do.
It can't be done.
Is that really important?
Let me know as soon as he comes back.
I only need one hundred dollars.
You're so sweet.
I was just fooling around.
Do you mind if I open the window?
Water is leaking into my goggles. I don't think they fit right.
I'm the manager.
They didn't offer me anything to drink.
Come again tomorrow.
I followed the rules.
I'm still waiting for your answer.
The man committed murder.
We just need to stay calm.
Why did you bring a gun?
Your bike is better than mine.
I found something very interesting.
I don't ever want us to be apart.
I've been given permission to inspect this equipment.
What a gorgeous flower!
How about going swimming?
The dog looks hungry.
They showed it to our company.
We can't help you anymore.
It may be our only hope.
I've been shopping all day.
The birth rate and death rate were nearly equal.
Your smile always makes me happy.
The children made a giant snowman.
We walked to the park.
I have a few things to finish up before I go home.
I don't belong here.
It reminded me of you.
You're too loud.
She used to go to the museum on Sundays.
My friends stood by me during the court case.
I just followed your instructions.
I think Tom did a really nice job.
Do you have any rock CDs?
Let's leave it up to him.
I read all kinds of books.
He left ten minutes ago.
Think before you speak.
Tom studies French as well.
I'm afraid it may rain tomorrow.
I'll treasure it.
I'm wealthy.
Are you following me?
I was present at the meeting.
Do you know why?
I want to walk.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Do you like surprises?
She's got a point.
They have very little to live on.
Tom hates being disturbed when he's studying.
How fast does this car go?
I'm not a teacher.
How long will the meeting last?
I will give you what little money I have.
A small company employs 50 people.
Did you have fun?
You don't have any reason to be jealous.
I couldn't stand the noise anymore.
They say that you never forget your first love.
Tom left me with no choice.
We're getting it.
Tell it to the cops.
I can teach you how to cook.
You don't have to talk.
What did they do to you?
He parties too much.
It's getting darker and darker.
Look at that bird.
Have you ever forgotten your phone number?
He confessed his crime.
The latest issue of the magazine will come out next Monday.
We know you're interested.
Tom doesn't know.
She is young.
I don't sleep much.
He scolded her.
I arrived at school on time.
I outrank you.
We all make mistakes.
I hope it's true.
They're eating dinner now in the dining room.
It'll come in handy.
Shut the door tight.
You are entitled to try once again.
Tom asked Mary to show him some of her artwork.
He opened the door.
I've always paid the rent.
We have different points of view.
I don't want any more.
I thought you'd want to know.
Please correct me if I make a mistake.
I don't expect you to be my friend.
I don't want to be alone with Tom.
Are you alone?
The storm became even more violent.
I made plans.
I didn't sleep well.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I'm married to a lawyer.
He is a good tennis player.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
Tom seemed disappointed.
I have abandoned the idea of buying a house.
Schedules are difficult to coordinate.
Tom shared a jail cell with John.
I just want what's best for you.
I'm making a lot more money now.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
I am a student of this school.
Don't interfere in others' affairs.
I don't have any pencils.
I'm putting all my effort into this project.
I'd be grateful if you could take a look when you've got time sometime.
Tom felt someone touch his arm.
I'm going to have to think about that one.
It's about time.
Where's the book I need?
You should go.
We can't find Tom.
The man injured in the accident was taken to the hospital.
Have you ever been lonely?
The room didn't have a single window.
Would you be willing to share your code with me?
That's what you've always wanted.
I'm fascinated.
I didn't say I wasn't going.
I remember seeing you before.
He did the opposite.
They left.
They were panting.
Do you have any idea who did this?
You're not safe here.
I wonder what Tom would do.
Are you sure that's safe?
They worked together to put out the fire.
I say it's time for a change.
She met him this morning.
Have you finished the suggested reading?
People came to like her paintings.
I'm glad you see it that way.
Is there somebody you want to call?
Snap out of it!
You should get some exercise.
Let's begin with this problem.
Why are you being mean to me?
I really don't get you.
They're anxious for peace.
I'm not used to sleeping in a tent.
I'll do that later.
Are you sure we have enough food?
How could I forget you?
You must prepare yourself for the worst.
I had a good time at the party.
I will be studying when you come at seven.
I saw you.
We're soulmates.
What did you do to my phone?
I think you're ready.
You should not break your promise.
The leaves fell from the trees.
Why don't you have any clothes on?
I felt like I would die.
My leg is still hurting.
I'll make some coffee.
They accused me of being a liar.
Just relax.
You're overconfident.
They plan to have a party.
We had to abandon our plan.
Do you really believe it's necessary to do that?
Everybody's in bed.
Can you describe the situation you were in?
Tom encouraged Mary.
What can you see?
I know what's happening at home.
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
Are you going to a movie?
The effect was quite different from what was intended.
Tom must be wrong.
Medical marijuana is legal in this state.
That's what the government wants.
I'll ask my brother to give me a ride.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
He painted his bicycle red.
Is it love?
Did you live here before?
He scrunched down in his seat so that I wouldn't see him.
Keep in touch with me.
He always leaves the window open while he sleeps.
You're the teacher.
I actually enjoyed that.
She speaks fairly quickly.
Please handle it with the utmost care.
Tom hasn't been living here long.
You must know Tom pretty well.
Could you take our picture?
Don't be scared to meet new people.
Just tell me what you want.
I asked my mother if breakfast was ready.
It's very kind of you to help me with my homework.
I'm never at home on Sundays.
I wasn't looking at you.
I am uncomfortable in these new shoes.
Tom's left.
Don't make me beg for it.
Don't die on me.
He gave a vague answer.
None of this is good.
None of this is your fault.
The most precious resource we have is time.
There's no speed limit.
His car was seriously damaged.
I'll sue you.
What's the next station?
I gave up my job.
I swim every day.
He knocked on the door.
The city hall isn't far from here.
I can't do all of this without a little help.
Do you want to go to a soccer game?
Why do you laugh so hard at his jokes? They're not even funny.
He was cheating.
He fought against racial discrimination.
Why do you want to do that?
I get only five days off this summer.
I've been very busy lately.
We argued politics.
I hope that you feel better tomorrow.
Don't talk to me like that.
Stop the car.
I'll sleep here.
I made up my mind to go there.
Tom and Mary were on the same wavelength.
Can't you speak French?
What are the other men doing?
I just fainted. That's all.
They discussed the problem.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
I have better things to do than stand here and take your insults.
Do you want to try it?
I paid for these tickets.
Don't worry. I'm not mad at you.
You told me you'd come.
Who says Tom knew?
I regret that decision.
The boy threw a paper airplane at the teacher.
Did you know Tom didn't like swimming?
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
Tom wore a straw hat.
It's completely irrational.
We don't want anything like that to ever happen again.
Do you want to do it together?
Tom sat on the window sill.
They were in the right place at the right time.
I didn't realize you could speak French.
He was going to school.
I'll need to check my schedule.
It is possible.
Do you offer any day trips?
Do you need some water?
He was late to the appointment due to a traffic accident.
It's natural that she should get angry.
I can't remember the last time I've seen you so excited about something.
I want what you want.
Tom read the letter aloud.
Are we going to do that?
That's real nice of you.
Was that all you wanted to say to me?
I lost the watch my father had given me.
This is a proverb that I don't understand.
I hope your wishes will come true.
One of them is a spy.
Why is this door open?
I'm fine.
I think now is the time.
Can you guess what I have?
I know you're disappointed.
I haven't seen this movie before.
I won't tolerate that anymore.
I really hope things work out for you.
He listened to the music with his eyes closed.
I caught a glimpse of her face.
I'm not going to stay if you don't want me to.
Do you know what would happen if you drank that?
What did they say to you?
We have two dogs. One is black and the other is white.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I'm feeling fit.
He has a lot of land.
I saw Tom standing there.
Don't tell anyone.
Don't run.
I'm a salesperson.
I'm completely wrecked.
Never give up.
She is a very intelligent young lady.
The baby is asleep.
Do exactly as I say.
Let me handle it.
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
They have a problem.
I wish that she would stop smoking.
I guess the dog bites.
How long is this visa good for?
There were bullet holes in the windshield.
The cat climbed up the tree.
Are you going to vote today?
I felt the same way.
Everyone sat down.
Put your hat back on.
Does it matter?
Knowledge is power.
That's really nice.
This desk is better than that one.
The castle is across the river.
I like my friends.
Tom lost 30 kilograms.
She saw him at the station.
Aren't you glad you didn't go to Boston?
Many countries have problems with poverty.
She must have been very beautiful.
Could you solve the problem?
That's icky.
You're lying!
He felt himself being lifted up.
Tom is smarter than Mary.
I want to sing a song.
This camera is less expensive than that one.
I have to do something while I still can.
Take care of yourselves!
I want you to get me a soda.
It is made partly of wood.
She devoted herself to him.
I can't put up with the noise any longer.
Don't open your book.
Did you watch TV yesterday?
I'm extroverted.
Are you a policeman?
Let's go back to the motel.
He never gave in to temptation.
I hate it when people tell me what to do.
It'll definitely rain.
I don't know if I have enough time.
Laser printers are generally less expensive to maintain than ink jet printers.
We work with what we have.
It's eight o'clock at night.
One after another the animals died.
He fainted in the middle of his speech.
Do I need to wear a tie?
I enjoyed it.
I'm a salesman for our company.
I'm not fighting.
I really wish you would do that.
The boy came running into the room.
This truck has a flat tire.
He landed a big trout.
Help me pick out a tie to go with this suit.
You're really gorgeous.
I love Australia.
Are you sure you're all right?
Tom killed Mary because he found out she had started the fire that had killed his family.
This piece of information is very important to us.
My plan worked.
This book isn't as heavy as that one.
I'd like to earn my keep while I'm staying with you.
I know you can't wait.
Both men were executed.
The population of this village had decreased.
Cows are eating grass in the meadow.
We're not certain of that yet.
It's an interesting argument.
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
He is always isolated from his fellow workers.
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do.
I told you that you weren't supposed to do it.
I started to cry.
I've never seen anything more beautiful in my life.
I am shorter than you.
Haste makes waste.
I know Tom is self-conscious.
He pretends to be deaf.
I really appreciate this.
I don't like powdered sugar.
What kind of books do you like?
I thought we could talk.
I'm so overworked.
Maybe I should go with you.
I told you to sign the document.
When did you last see my brother?
You're not bleeding.
They were playing footsie under the table.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
We both want to go to Boston.
Did I say that?
He hates himself.
They want more.
Don't make this personal.
He is uncertain about his future.
I have so many things to tell you.
I don't even think about it anymore.
The garden was surrounded by a wooden fence.
Be kind to old people.
Could we talk in private?
No taxi stopped.
Tom stared at his feet.
Quit acting like a baby.
We have a lot to learn from each other.
I remember the warmth of his arms.
She prodded him to work harder.
I didn't think we'd need it.
A large crowd of people gathered.
Why can't we talk now?
Your name was mentioned.
It will be hot tomorrow.
I burned myself on the stove.
I know Tom is a tough guy.
Tom was brokenhearted.
I had to look after you.
Does anybody hear me?
Where were you born?
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Disable the alarm.
We knew no one.
Is anyone hurt?
How does Tom plan to help?
Please fix it.
I provided him with food.
Everyone's dead.
I remember that I closed the door.
The meeting was all but over.
There is no running water.
You didn't pay.
My parents don't know.
Tom wanted to talk about something else.
I got a useful piece of information out of him.
I never thought we'd end up like this.
The funeral is tomorrow.
That's the building where my dad works.
She appears to have many friends.
Where could they be?
We happened to meet at the station.
Tom followed me to the garage.
I like to be thorough.
I've never stopped loving you.
She helped him tie his tie.
He lives in a posh apartment near Central Park.
My grandfather likes to walk.
Oceans do not so much divide the world as unite it.
I'd be delighted if that happened again.
We found him alive.
My hair is wet.
Where are your kids?
Are you traveling alone?
You must let me handle this.
Why are you looking at me?
What will you have to do? asked her friend.
Her communication skills could be improved.
Women eat lighter meals when they're eating with a guy.
I was thinking about the plan.
Let's see if Tom can stay away.
I made a lot of money.
Stop changing the subject.
He closely resembles his father.
Tom seems to have trouble walking.
Did you see the show?
These politicians are corrupt.
I've asked you repeatedly not to do that.
He was my best friend.
I didn't realize you were awake.
I'm playing a computer game.
How many goats do they have?
I'm in a desperate situation.
Everyone waited.
I know he's the one who did it.
I want to sit by the window.
We missed the deadline.
That's a stupid name.
Do you really think that I'm going to let you do that?
I want to show you something.
I know Tom is miserable.
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
May I sit next to you?
She seems to be very ill.
She burst into tears.
This guy's great at pitching curveballs.
I left my briefcase on the bus.
I know what happened to Tom.
We're pretty proud of that.
You must not say it.
His words surprised me.
I want you back.
You're very sharp.
You'll get a lot of presents on your birthday.
You don't have to apologize.
I was on the wrong track.
At least try to come on time.
I know you're not comfortable.
They are all college students.
Is there a museum in this town?
Don't be alarmed.
They're cool.
You can always quit the job.
You don't understand the procedure.
This house is large enough for your family to live in.
I'm the only one planning to do that.
I can't believe this is actually happening.
The mistakes are mine.
You should be more careful.
Can I borrow it for about two weeks?
She tried to lower her expenses.
The truth is I don't like Tom.
I'm going to do that for you.
I ran as fast as I could.
Start the car.
Can you help me a little?
It's not a conspiracy.
The smoke alarm has never been maintained.
I remember those days.
I want to be a nurse.
Tom bought me a kite.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
I like your tie.
It's not brain surgery.
I don't want you at my party.
Mary is one of the richest women in the world.
I want you all to myself.
I was humiliated.
You need to calm down and pull yourself together.
Snails move slowly.
I feel like I've been cheated.
We need a tool to open it with.
They had no money left.
I was born in Tokyo on the eighth of January in 1950.
You're the only woman I've ever really loved.
Mary and Alice are sisters.
That's what makes me nervous.
I don't go hunting as often as I used to.
Would you mind if I ate a piece of this pie?
Each of us has to be careful when driving.
Let's continue this tomorrow.
Both of you are wrong.
I need that.
Do you think the shooting was accidental?
A child is missing.
Tom stole Mary's bicycle.
Are you trying to scare me?
I don't want to overreact.
I'm very thirsty.
Why do you want to study abroad?
Do you believe him?
I didn't get a chance to introduce myself to her.
I got injured doing that.
Why is no one doing that?
I have many model cars.
This map is worthless.
Did you have a rough day?
This room doesn't get much sunshine.
They are singers.
How many hours a day does Tom swim?
Is this love?
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
He came home at almost midnight.
Have you decided on the subject of your thesis?
I avoid crossing the street here if I am in a hurry.
The chicken is a bit too dry.
This is totally insane.
You're out of booze.
Give the money to my son.
I like trains.
Time flies like an arrow.
Several roads are flooded.
I just got a raise.
Why didn't you run away?
Feel free to call me if you need anything.
I want you to get in your car.
This is the largest dictionary there is in this library.
That's one of them.
Tom and Mary know each other so well that they often finish each other's sentences.
I've lost your phone number.
I don't often get invited to parties.
Did you tell Tom why you're here?
What caused the explosion?
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
I came here to study.
It was really no problem.
I hate being photographed.
We were disconnected.
I'll be glad to come.
You're not dead yet.
Tom is truly gifted.
You're a good journalist.
I wasn't interested in the job.
Both my feet are swollen.
We don't have a second choice.
I think Tom would be terrified.
Where are your friends going?
It was a secret.
I never thought I'd have so much fun.
It's the size of a small car.
Who kissed you?
She spends all her time thinking about boys.
I want to go abroad.
You've done it!
I had some work that I needed to do.
Can I get you a cup of tea?
Tom is a fairly good swimmer.
I got fined.
We got up at dawn.
Tom was guilty of spreading lies about Mary.
Tom corrected himself.
I read the book from beginning to end.
The basket was full of apples.
It was a judgment call.
They got to be good friends.
You look very dignified.
You don't know what you're doing.
I'm not ready to do that.
You're a bit shorter than I am.
I look forward to meeting you again soon.
How long does it last?
They left without me.
The surgery was yesterday.
I have a place to sleep.
I have everything here that I need.
Tom is looking for someone who speaks French.
You had better turn off the light before you go to sleep.
Get these people out of here.
That's how I lost my job.
It was light enough.
Tom died at a very old age.
Tom exaggerates.
Take a deep breath.
She always fed her children before she fed her dog.
It's not uncommon for people to give fake personal information when registering to use websites.
You may use my dictionary.
Does that seem wise?
She introduced her sister to him.
I really do have to go.
I want to spend more time doing things that make me happy.
I didn't know apple trees grow from seeds.
It took all day.
He writes letters to his mother.

Tom has passed away.
You've found it.

A customs declaration is required.
It's incredible.
Are you on Facebook?
I just want to keep things nice and simple.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
You should make sure that you get there on time. Tom won't wait more than ten minutes if you are late.
I can't imagine what it must've been like.
I advise you never to live beyond your income.
I need food.
She played tennis all day yesterday.
It is none the less true.
This handbag is mine.
How did he come by this money?
I'm in the bathroom.
He is an old friend of mine.
I learned from the best.
He's here trying to stir up trouble.
My parents aren't home right now.
I can't hear a thing.
Can we close the door?
Does anyone know you're here?
Why are you staring at me like that?
They hated each other.
What does it feel like to always have people following you around?
I'll be free.
Does it work?
Are you ready to order?
We're newlyweds.
You may go.
I just wanted to check my email.
I thought you'd be different.
Any student can answer that question.
Doctors thought he had a cold.
The teacher welcomed the new students.
We're boys.
Are you sure you did everything you were supposed to do?
These are questions that matter.
I'm the youngest one here.
She wouldn't give him the time of day.
I can't live without a TV.
I try to travel with only one suitcase.
Our parents should be taken care of.
We're studying French and web design.
I didn't need to understand French to know that they were angry.
It was a rumor.
You are not Japanese.
The population of Japan is much larger than that of Australia.

A hundred years is called a century.
Would you like to go shopping tomorrow?
I forgot his address.
Things took a sudden turn for the worse.
I'm not discouraged.
I don't have a bicycle.
He can run faster than I can.
We've isolated the problem.
It's your turn to shuffle.
Don't say such things.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
She was the last woman I expected to see.
Where is your homework?
She kept quiet.
We don't forget.
She advised him to give up smoking.
I have sore feet.
I think you might need my help.
Kiss Tom.
I'm doing that this morning.
I remember that guy.
He was able to solve the problem.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle?
I think that would be better.
My doctor advised me to give up smoking.
I'm not good at drawing.
They need the money.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
I won't pretend I'm sorry.
That's good to hear.
That's why he got angry.
How do you get the most bang for the buck?
I just want to say I'm glad you're here.
I had no time to eat.
I will go to the meeting.
The spider web glistened in the morning dew.
Tom likes to do that here.
What's the big hurry?
Why are you upset?
Several yachts were sailing side by side far out at sea.
Hippopotamuses love water.
You must be in love.

They are very compatible.
Is there something in particular that you want?
Are you questioning my loyalty?
I like blue.
My father doesn't like football.
We wouldn't stand a chance.
Everyone smiled.
You're resourceful.
That helps a lot.
I didn't ask you to do that.
Cheers!
Can you wake me up at seven o'clock tomorrow morning?
They never pay any attention to me.
Is sugar cane a fruit?
I sat beside her.
This is the place where the battle took place.
Let me see what it looks like.
This benefits no one.
Tom and Mary dated each other for three years.
They agreed on a price.
Laughter is good for your health.
You're the oldest.
Tom had loving parents.
I won't give them to you.

The results are inconclusive.
It's a quarter past nine.

Let's walk to the lake.
Do you need our help?
I'm not sure anymore.

What happens next?
I'm supposed to do that by myself.
I have at least ten books.
How did you get into Harvard?
Do you think the road is wide enough for cars?
Why are you asking?
What's this street called?
Are you looking for someone?
I really don't want to go out on a date with Mary.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
I think you're ready.
I'm not mean.
That's what saved me.
Nature plays an important role in our life.
We can do a lot more than that.
I'll pay you a visit sometime.
I don't like it when you swear.
There isn't any milk in the glass.
We baked it together.
Tom entered his password.
The students did the work themselves.
Call if you need me.
Tom said that he didn't want to go to Mary's party.
Why are there so many dishonest people in the world?
I wonder what your friend Tom is doing now.
I can run.
I cannot find fault with him.
She's a violinist of some renown.
Did I wake you?
Here she comes.

I think Tom did well.
I'd like to have these pants cleaned.
I think we both know why I'm here.

What'll you do if it rains?
May I ask a favor of you?

You're the greatest.
Do you have a mobile phone?
I know none of the three men.
I don't know Tom's girlfriend.
He is above suspicion.
We have another decision to make.
I have an appointment with my uncle tomorrow.
Why are you jealous of me?
I hate my body.
Tom made a sandwich.
I'll handle this one.
I don't know what you want to hear.
Tom is studying in Boston.
The pen is on the desk.
Japan imports oranges from California.
I want to spend time with you.
I feel normal.
Try not to forget anything.
Here's your drink.
I'll sit with Tom.
He worked hard to save up some money.
He says that he wants to settle down.
What sorts of weapons did they have?
My GPS works very well.
That's very considerate of you.
Sit down and shut up.
I'm almost as tall as Tom.
I am moving next month.
Turn on the air conditioner.
I'll study your report.
I want you to speak frankly.
They're not a threat.
Tom deserves a promotion.
She ran over her lines once before she went on stage.
What are you trying to hide?
I am terribly busy because the report deadline is near.
I can trace my ancestors back 200 years.
You can't swim here.
Stop deluding yourself.
Is there somebody you want to call?
I'm not a genius.
Is Tom supposed to be doing that?
It was the most painful thing in my life.
He is cranky.
I don't have any homework today.
I don't think Tom will give it back.
I always said no.
Forget it.
You'd better consult the doctor.
The soldier returned home on a furlough.
My roommate complained about the noise.

I stayed with a friend of mine.
She asked me what had become of him.
That's how I do everything.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom is now in custody.
I'm really shocked.
She expected him to solve the problem.
It's going really well.
She was ashamed of her children's behavior.
She didn't want to sell the book.
Turn it off.
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.
You need to get off at the next station.
There wasn't much else we could do.
Tom said that it probably wouldn't rain until evening.
I can't wait to eat it.

Tom is not as smart as he likes to think he is.
Your thirty minutes are up.
Did you do that for me?
Is this yours?

How did you find this?
They moved here three years ago.
She's a fixture at all the high-society parties.

She took him for all his money.
I found the test difficult.
Do you think I'm too tall?

I contributed.
Have you ever kissed another guy?

We need three more of these.
What are they going to do?
We all quit.
He spends too much money.
They rely on the foodbank.
The word is unfamiliar to me.
Tom introduced Mary to his family.
We were all concerned.
It's sort of strange.
He never loses hope.
You alone can help me.
You're not as beautiful as you think you are.
Please have a seat and wait until your name is called.
The environment must be protected.
I don't have any nice clothes.
I look forward to our next meeting.
I only need a minute.
Don't wait up.
I don't believe in religion.
I know you're not scared.
Where did you buy that hat?
Could you come back a little later?
Men never cry.
Butter is made from milk.
I want to build a house here.

One must follow the rules.
Bring the water to a boil.
Do you like French wine?
This is a common error.
How do you know that Tom isn't a native speaker?
You are really very good.
It all happened quickly.
It's my biggest problem.
The school is five kilometers from my home.
Could you hand me the newspaper on the table?
It would be fun to see how things change over the years.
Do you think I did it?
Would you say it once more?
Tom opened a window.
School is a waste of time.
Do you have safety deposit boxes?
Are you a law student?
Be careful on your way back home.
Both you and I should lose a little weight.
He earns three times more than me.
I have never seen her help her father.
He is breathing hard.
Just relax.
Let's hope Tom can do that.
Did I do something stupid?
This is my horse.
Give me another example.
I don't like chocolate.
Can you promise me that?
I could hear Tom yelling.
Don't be disgusting.
I nailed it.
He has a beautiful daughter.
They stayed at a luxury hotel.
Why are you so mean?
It's a big concern.
You're always criticizing me!
We're all trying to win.
We want to talk to you.
She pulled my shirt.
This pen belongs to me.
The traffic light changed to red.
May I trouble you to shut the window?
Thirty-four of them were lawyers.
We have broken off relations with them.
He began with a joke.
I was absent from the party.
I never thought it would be this bad.
Come over!
A business cycle is a recurring succession of periods of prosperity and periods of depression.
The disease spread in several ways.
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.
It won't cost you a dime.
Is it a recent picture?
Where are we going tonight?
What is the book about?
You write well.
We're stuck.
What's this book about?
Get it out of here.
All but one were present.
She died from TB.
You're not good at this.
Swimming should help you lose weight.
I didn't need to understand French to know that they were angry.
Don't pull my sleeve.
Why don't you do that yourself?
His death was partly my fault.
It's no use complaining.
You read too much.
She was crying with pain.
He is what is called a gentleman.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
Thank you for your gift.
She is a nurse.
Can you tell us what the bank robber looked like?
He seems to have been ill.
It rained continuously for three days.
That only makes the problem worse.
I'll arrange that for you.
It was a quiet winter evening.
Why wasn't I informed earlier?
You're the one who trained me.
I love you.
We always play tennis on Saturday morning.
They did away with the old system.
That's not uncommon.
I was very surprised to see students cleaning their classroom after school.
He can't be under thirty.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
You're not invincible.
I lost ten kilos in three months.
Did they hurt you?
We heard gunshots from next door.
Give him a hug.
Tom knew that he'd been tricked.
Tom is dying.
He traveled all over Europe.
We can't live without oxygen.
Are you the one who wrote this?
I value your friendship very much.
I was born in 1960.
They were frustrated.
Expect no mercy.
I telephoned her at once.
I met an old friend by chance in Kyoto.
I want a person who can speak French.
I've found something I'd like to show you.
Don't tell anybody.
I urge caution.
I could never sing a song like that in public.
Tom and Mary usually speak to each other in French.
He is our teacher of English.
How long will it take?
I don't have all the facts.
I have to buy a new pair of skis.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
Can I speak with you a moment?
How's your old lady doing?
She went to the museum by taxi.
Who told you you needed to do that?
Should I call you or will you call me?
Don't look at me.
Are you still there?
That sounded like a gunshot.
I really miss you all.
Would you like to switch seats?
Summer is almost over.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
We promised to stand by him in case of trouble.
She is always complaining about something or other.
I don't like to make mistakes.
Stop acting like a jerk.
Who died?
I'd like you to make one now.
He fell asleep behind the wheel and had an accident.
Today is my lucky day.
He leaves for China tomorrow.
You are both in the wrong.
You did it in front of the staff.
The best way to learn a foreign language is to go live in a country where it's spoken.
Who's taking responsibility for this?
You're a victim of the system.
I always keep my promises.
Wash the dishes.
What will they do to us?
My parents want me to come home.
I can't see that far.
Are you sure you can do this?
Try to think of something else.
I was surprised by his sudden appearance.
He is a brave and cheerful boy.
Can you recommend a good restaurant for dinner?
You know as well as I do that Tom isn't a very good singer.
I always walk.
I have no details.
Did you really dream about me?
The crops have withered.
I don't have long.
Eating too much may lead to sickness.
Tom smells weird.
I was trying to kill time.
Tom's alone.
Wash the dishes.
How's your day going?
It's yours if you want it.
The water is cold.
I know Tom is optimistic.
I've known her for more than twenty years.
I won't deny that.
I was tempted to call in sick.
Someone grabbed me from behind.
Men are pigs.
It's not worth worrying about it.
Words cannot convey my feelings.
He's not sure he's ready.
The furniture belongs to my mother.
It's up to you.
He told me that he wanted to leave the company.
Tom won't likely be mistaken.
You're losing.
I don't know which to choose.
Don't stay here.
Were they good?
We were really excited.
Stop showing off!
Stand back!
You can go anyplace you like.
I remember asking an old man the way.
It is regrettable that you did not start earlier.
I wanted to know where the voice was coming from.
The battery's dead.
Get into your car.
What condition is the building in?
Lead the way.
Did you enjoy the game?
I just brewed a pot.
Turn on the ignition.
Do you really think Tom is innocent?
Who ordered that?
She showed me which dress to wear.
I fear for the future of mankind.
I live here.
You are under oath.
Where is the station?
I was very exhausted.
Do you find the work too hard?
It's a complete disaster.
I'm excited.
Tom locked himself in his room and cried.
I want you to do nothing.
I'm still intimidated by you.
I'll drive you home.
I'm not leaving you.
When are you going to come?
Murder is against the law.
I wonder whether or not Tom will have to do that.
I'll be here on Monday.
We have more important matters to discuss.
I got a suntan.
He continued the experiment.
You don't look comfortable.
Tom isn't good at math.
My throat is a bit dry.
Why are you being so negative?
Hold still.
I'm too tired to go out for a run.
Do you speak Chinese?
I study math harder than English.
I caught him stealing the money.
Look at me and do what I do.
I think we can do this without any extra help.
Where were they sent?
Is there anyone in the room?
I'd like to have a word with you.
I'm very glad to finally meet you.
That one's all yours.
I sure wish I could speak French better.
You've done enough.
She is ashamed to speak up.
I absolutely must know what you're planning to do.
They're not alone.
What are you doing on Monday?
May I look at that magazine?
Please say hello to your parents.
Don't kid me!
I hope you'll both be happy together.
Enter the room.
A chance like this only comes along once in a blue moon.
Release him.
You should've let Tom do what he wanted to do.
What's behind that door?
Your ideas about the government are different from mine.
I had to lie again.
Give it to whoever needs it.
I am searching for my brother.
I want everybody to be happy.
You should be in your room.
I love being a teacher.
I thought you were asleep.
I'm not accusing anyone of anything.
She lived a happy life.
Let's wait a while.
The back wheels on that tractor have ball bearings the size of my fist.
She asked him to call her later.
I can't keep living the way I've been living.
Can you recommend a good book?
My purse was stolen on the bus.
Is this really all that important?
What's your favorite drink in the summer?
You're very direct.
Tom wanted Mary to meet his parents.
The rain came down in torrents.
We have a lot of free time this week.
We need to be prepared.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
My little finger is swollen.
I only eat meat about three times a week.
Children should be taught to share.
I've already made it.
I don't quite know how it happened.
Are you courageous?
Are you seriously thinking about buying that old car?
My wallet's been stolen.
This is really humiliating.
Did you know she is good at making coffee?
I won't say anything.
Did you see anyone at the mall?
The rabbit hid behind the tree.
Where can I buy snacks?
Will you watch the Olympics?
That was sweet.
How did you come up with that answer?
I left in the morning.
We didn't find it.
That was a problem.
That was a close call.
Tom is average height.
Don't talk to anyone.
All the students study English.
You drive a hard bargain.
It's an abuse of power.
Would you like some cookies?
A parrot can mimic a person's voice.
I'm buying candy and cookies.
She is always complaining of her small salary.
The wind blew all day.
I was just taking a shower.
How are we going to get inside?
She hates carrots.
Will you lend me your dictionary?
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
Tom and Mary have different philosophies of life.
Is there someone with you?
China is rich in natural resources.
I didn't see anyone.
He writes to his parents once a month.
I thought I heard you.
I am tired of eating at the school cafeteria.
I am just dying for a Coke right now.
I still have to do that.
Tom died trying to save a child from a burning building.
Let me check.
There's no other explanation.
I would like to improve my English pronunciation.
Where's the train station?
I don't think you can sell that.
This is an old building.
Where can we park?
You must keep the promises you make.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
He's an Italian teacher.
It will take me 20 minutes to get to the station by taxi.
We have no one but ourselves to blame for that.
That doesn't look too hard.
I watch television after supper.
I never thought I'd find a woman like you.
She wants to dance.
It depends on how much money you have.
They were afraid of being overheard.
You'll always be welcome here.
I heard the leaves rustling.
Wake me up at eight.
I do not like music.
Tom is hardly ever at home.
Don't walk out on me again.
I became aware of someone looking at me.
Every minute counts.
We should observe the speed limit.
I'm still thirsty.
Tom didn't tell anyone that he'd won the lottery.
It's for the children.
Tom told me he wasn't planning on eating out today.
I walk across that bridge every morning on the way to school.
The leaves of the trees began to turn red.
I didn't know Tom was still working here.
I've seen that.
I met him at the end of the platform.
The cat arched its back and stretched itself.
Tom forgot his umbrella on the bus.
I have complete faith in my doctor.
Tom went to Mary's house.
Glass breaks easily.
I never should've mentioned it.
I want mine.
I hate the color of these walls.
I have no excuse.
Introducing democratic ideas into that country will be a slow process.
I wanted to make a few phone calls.
I do not feel guilty.
What should I do to find a suitable job for myself?
May I begin by thanking every one for your warm welcome?
I'm not your enemy.
Stop talking and start listening.
I thought you liked me.
I don't want to handle it.
I can't hear Tom.
Did you meet someone else?
We're people like everybody else.
Look at what you did.
Sheep are bred for their fleece and their meat.
I am a man who can't stand being alone.
I hope it'll be fine tomorrow.
I think we should quit.
What are you going to do next?
Wait a sec.
We're all sure of that.
Would you show us some samples of your work?
Stay a while and listen.
I didn't catch your last name.
I've been all over the world.
Tom was found dead in his room.
I love my mother.
I'm fed up with English.
That's what I should've said.
Tom is deeply in love with Mary.
The flowers brightened up the room.
She advised him to do more exercise.
You didn't have to lie.
The little boy said hello to me.
London is one of the largest cities in the world.
Steel production is estimated to reach 100 million tons this year.
He is a famous artist.
I saw the pictures.
The lock must be broken.
Laughing is really good for you.
They invited her to go to the party.
I don't eat out as often as I'd like.
Tom is lying.
I'll need to make some more tests.
How do you know where to go?
Where are you going this afternoon?
Will you give me something to drink?
You don't have to apologize.
We gave our word.
I will come to your country some day.
I'm not coming back.
My idea is different from yours.
I think we'd better take a break.
I trust him.
I'm following the guidelines.
You are naughty.
I'm surprised to see you.
I figured you'd be impressed.
Tom stood there for a while.
Your hypothesis is completely unrealistic.
Where is the emergency exit?
Show me another watch.
I need to press the button.
I shouldn't complain.
It's like being in a candy store.
Tom eats nothing but his mother's cooking.
I must open the window.
You don't look pleased to see me.
How many players are there?
I'm not saying that we can't win. I'm just saying it's not likely.
Were you here last week?
All the prisoners escaped.
This newspaper is free.
Let me just finish this.
What do you make of that?
Where's the original?
He's a late bloomer.
I'm married to a lawyer.
I like playing the piano.
I hadn't really thought about that.
I was a passenger.
No one panicked.
You can't kill both of us.
The principal shook hands with each of the graduates.
She pushed the door open.
I thought I'd surprise you.
Tom and I like the same kind of music.
This is the watch that I'd lost.
It took me a lot less time to housebreak my German shepherd than it took to housebreak my other dog.
I knew this was a waste of time.
She is related to him.
It's your turn to wash the dishes.
We're out of beer.
Do you actually like this?
Does Tom plan to help us?
I almost never make mistakes.
It's probably just a phase.
She burst into tears when she heard the news.
Keep looking.
You're respected by everybody.
There's usually someone here.
I'm resilient.
Tom is almost ready to leave.
I just don't want to catch your cold.
He acted the part of King Lear.
What would you like to be called?
Tom is behind Mary.
Papa made sure all the lights were turned off before going to bed.
Let's focus on that.
She had a narrow escape.
The ice gave way under his weight.
I thought you were a friend.
He seems satisfied with my explanation.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I'm not angry.
Anyone can make a mistake.
Everybody started to leave.
You're totally right.
Are all of these people your friends?
Do you like that?
One in ten people have myopia.
I remember seeing you all somewhere.
Do you know where my keys are?
Do you know Tom's wife's name?
Why don't you loosen up?
I said this a long time ago.
It looks like you're having a great time.
You can't trust anything he says.
I could feel the sand between my toes.
I don't mind lending you the money provided you pay it back within a month.
You should learn from your mistakes.
Why are you waiting?
It's too hot.
Form two lines.
Tom and his friends are swimming in the pool.
I leave home before eight o'clock every morning.
I know Tom is done.
Who forced you to do that?
Let's continue the game after lunch.
Tom travels a lot.
Japan relies on Arab countries for oil.
What else do you have in your pocket?
I thought you'd wear something like that.
I think you deserve more than this.
How could you not notice?
She moved my clothes.
What shall we do?
Are you saying my life is in danger?
He hesitated before answering.
It's a tradition.
He started to speak English.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
How old do you think she is?
I'm taking care of my grandfather.
Gay marriage is legal here.
Everybody's dead.
Are you talking to me?
He got off the train.
Can I borrow some money from you?
Don't you regret getting that tattoo?
I'm not short.
Tom can run fast.
Who's watching?
Are you telling me you're not involved?
He's a talented young director.
All the people present were moved by his speech.
Show me your papers!
What should we do with this?
The police officer put handcuffs on the suspect.
I thought you were having a good time.
Push the door open.
Give that book back to me.
Have you finished your homework yet?
She said something to him.
I'm going to change my shirt.
Health is above wealth.
I thought I was on time.
We'll try one more time.
I'd pay to see that.
The joke's on us.
I barely managed to finish the letter by eleven o'clock.
I'm sorry I'm late.
You attach too much importance to what he says.
Bring me my glasses.
Do you mind if I smoke?
Where's the library?
Tom caught Mary stealing his money from the cash register.
Tell me what your name is.
Are you still playing the bassoon?
Could you please tell me again what school you graduated from?
The company's stock price jumped yesterday.
I want to be with Tom.
Do as you're told.
Can I go to my room now?
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
No weapons were found.
The cyclist climbed the hill.
This is always the way it has been.
Are you referring to me?
I like to play with words.
I hate goat cheese.
He's swimming now.
That is so embarrassing.
She will have to cook for everyone.
I can't believe your mom let you go.
Why can't I see you?
He took a picture of the beautiful landscape.
He picked up a butterfly between his thumb and forefinger.
What's your horse's name?
Tom told me that he was determined to do that.
I decided to tell her that I love him.
Tom is a very creative person.
You've come too early.
He hurried to the station.
There isn't much time.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
I had to go.
It's not the same anymore.
Sea turtles always return to the beach where they hatched.
This is accurate.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
It was very windy yesterday.
Tell me what to do with it.
It was so dark that I couldn't see anything.
I have some extra tickets for the concert.
I wish she had come last night.
He's reading a novel now.
We met the other day.
I think you've had enough.
I want to answer the last question first.
It seems that the rainy season is finally over.
Climate change is a global problem.
How many did you want?
Go with Tom.
They broke out into spontaneous laughter.
I was threatened.
I only hope I'm not too late.
Take care.
I'd like to be a teacher.
There's someone else I want to see.
I've got a meeting at 2:30.
I'll think about it over the weekend.
Get me out of here now.
Do you want to drink?
Why don't you start by telling us how you feel?
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
You can't do that.
Don't close the door.
What happens tomorrow?
He will explain it to you when he comes back.
Tom and Mary are vegetarians.
Your house is fantastic.
He added that he didn't believe it.
I don't know who knows.
You need to do that today.
I know your brother.
I got a weird email.
I suppose I'd better leave.
There was a lot of food in the house.
I heard the song sung in French.
His eyes betrayed his fear.
That's a very difficult question.
We will make every effort to do so.
Why are you saying that to me?
Did you read what I wrote?
Are we leaving?
Tom is going to try again.
I can't let the matter drop.
The river's water level has risen.
That's what I have to do.
I talked to Tom this morning just before the meeting.
Everything changed.
We're not through yet.
What did you do during the holidays?
I've been evicted.
I don't plan on losing.
How long have you been busy?
Someone cleaned my room while I was gone.
Tom treats me like a child.
I did nothing during the holidays.
I can't thank you enough.
There are no problems.
There was no motive.
I don't understand what you are saying.
I need nine hours of sleep.
Let's call the whole thing off.
Why did you buy a car?
This report is very sloppily written.
I have to study for the test.
I'm looking for a sweater.
You'll find this lesson easy.
Do you understand me?
It's noisy next door.
It's already 7 o'clock.
It's very dry.
This is expensive.
Tom bought a new tennis racket.
That play was an immense success.
Experience is the best teacher.
Can I have a paper bag?
I hope I can be of some help to you.
I only need to buy one.
I like you very much.
I cannot afford to buy a car.
I took a picture of her.
Tom is trying to earn enough money to buy a new trumpet.
It matters a lot.
They brought trouble on themselves.
That'll put you in danger.
Where do you live?
How long will it take me to finish my homework?
He's a man now.
I do not understand her.
He would be glad to hear that.
I don't think I can help you very much.

He is fluent in Chinese.
Nuclear weapons are a threat to all humanity.

The sidewalks were wet after the rain.
I've been working here for many years.
I don't want to go outside this afternoon.
I want them all shot.
Is your gun loaded?
Is it something important?
I've waited for this too long.
These windows look to the south.

The company went public and became listed on the stock exchange in 1990.

I'm supporting you.
We're unemployed.
He loves soccer.
You have to see it.
Do you know all these people?
It's fun.
Keep the money in a safe place.
Roses have thorns.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
May I do that now?
I want you to understand this isn't going to be easy.
She's loved by her friends.
I'm very fortunate.
He has a rich imagination.
That wasn't too bad.
I answered the door.
Do you want me to walk you home?
You're unambitious.
I like turtles.
Are you ambitious?
It's not without risks.
I made him cry.
You just have to ask for it.
They're brave.
I know that your work isn't easy.
We were alone.
Could you pass the salt?
He rubbed his hands together.
He's scared of that dog.
They huddled together.
You should read between the lines.
I wanted to come.
Most of the shops were closed.
Wine helps with digestion.
He doesn't have any proof.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I looked down at the sea.
He wanted to succeed.
Tom hates me.
I'm shorter than you.
Don't you tell me my job.
It's hotter here in the valley than in the mountains.
I thought you were injured.
It's very difficult to understand him.

I never thought I'd see your face again.
I don't think you can do this.
Does this medicine work quickly?
You have to get this work finished by noon.
I was not drinking.
I was slightly surprised.
Her beauty exposed her to many dangers.
I don't think I can help you.
I think this will work.
Are you happy?
They should've noticed me.
She was always ready to help people in trouble.
That should've been enough.
Go ahead and talk.
Everyone loves their father.
How can anyone sleep with all this commotion going on?
I washed my T-shirt.
I'm surprised to see you.
I can't figure out how to register a new domain name.
Where do dreams come from?
Tom isn't a boy anymore.
Please write down what I say.
I'm a very lucky man.
How dare you speak to me like that!
I am in agreement with most of what he says.
He lives here all alone.
You know I don't have any money.
How can you be so cruel?
He and I have been good friends since we were children.
They are exhausted.
That worked pretty well.
He has nothing to complain about.
I'd like to ask you some questions about some of the people you've been working for.
I've come a long way.
Someone stole something from my bag.
Is there an elevator in this building?
Show me how to do that.
Monopolies are bad.
Don't delete this file.
This one has a lot of advantages over that one.
It's against my principles.

Tom told Mary that he didn't believe in astrology.
Today is Saturday.
No one has ever seen God.
Tom forgot to feed the dog.
We made a deal.
I think we need more information.
Let me know if you can make it tomorrow.
I like cats.
Remember not to tell anyone.
I was very lucky.
It won't take me much time to do that.
Why are you at home?
My son believes in Santa Claus.
They went there.
I am very tired.
I wish that I could do more.
I'd like to discuss the possibility of you coming to work for our company.
Let's get to work.
Why not use robots?
I just don't get modern sculpture.
This is a strange sentence.
I've finally found you.
Who did you go there with?
It's getting larger.
You can invite other people.
All our attempts failed.
Close the window.
Do you want to be left out?
You're powerful.
I don't like fried fish.
I will teach you.
I promised him to keep it secret.
Do you need to drink wine?
I rented out the guest bedroom.
A lot has happened this past week.
Perhaps he will come.
You'd better not stay up too late.
That's a nice rack of pork chops.
He began to look for a job.
How much money do you have on you right now?
Tom caught the ball with one hand.
I couldn't sleep all night.
You have a pretty good memory.
He cooked up a good excuse for not going to the party.
How dare you make fun of Tom!
I can't just not do anything.
He was known to everybody in the village.
A great warrior radiates strength. He doesn't have to fight to the death.
He explained it at length.
I didn't ask you to come here.
She wants to go out with him.

He's too drunk.
You won't be shot.
I haven't been happy for a long time.
I thought you'd never ask.
I'm ready to roll up my sleeves.
He ignored me.
He's about the same age as you are.
You'd make a good counselor.
He knows us very well.
Why did you listen to them?
He was too tired to go any further.
His camera is three times as expensive as mine.
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
Tom wanted Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
They were motivated by revenge.
He's a freelance journalist.
Give me a blank sheet of paper.
It rained yesterday.
You are beautiful.
I have fewer books than you.
I didn't want to intrude.
I've had enough.
I want guards posted here and I want them here now.
I didn't know how to reply.
There isn't much snow on the ground.
I felt happy.
Do you have an airplane ticket back home?
He is no ordinary student.

Does Tom sing well?
There are a lot of bridges in this city.
What is the length of this piece of cloth?
We're stuffed.
Can you take me with you on the plane?
No one knows what to say.
Should we add a little more salt?
A lot of people are going to tell you that you shouldn't have done that.
We took action immediately so that things wouldn't get worse.
Everybody wanted me to do it.
I don't take needless risks.
I want to make you happy.
I heard that Tom kissed Mary.
I suddenly became dizzy.
We don't need that stuff.
You do your part and I'll do the rest.
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
Which students will take the test?
Tom ate a tuna sandwich.
What is he like?
I know Tom is self-conscious.
Where is the American Airlines counter?
Are you happy right now?
It is useless to discuss the matter any further.
I stayed at a nice hotel.
What effect will that have?
The weather was bad this weekend.
Someone is coming.
Please show me your notebook.
I allowed her to go to the party.
I'm not very athletic.
I promise you I'll help you.
I'm glad you're OK again.
Do you like dogs?
Millions of workers lost their jobs.
When was the last time you went to an art gallery?
The apprentice is lazy.
His bicycle is different from this one.
You didn't need to come so early.
I'm being treated like a child.
I saw you.
I think that it's too big.
Where's your uncle?
I'd like you to have dinner with me.
I have absolutely nothing to do.
Tom never seems to finish anything.
I have something urgent to attend to.
Why does my dog hate Tom?
I prefer doing it this way.
I'm careful not to spend too much.
I admit that I'm tired.
Tom bought a shirt yesterday.
I'd like a room in the front.
I knew it was a trick.
Are you sure you didn't hear anything?
That's how I see it.
Tom says that he'll never do that.
I'm ambitious.
What projects are you working on now?
This is amazing.
I planted a tree.
Let's go somewhere where it's quiet.
What are you working on?
Face facts!
I know that this is strange.
Those pictures were painted by him.
Tom now lives near Boston.
I wrote him to ask why.
Can't you tell me how to do this?
I know Tom isn't guilty.
I could use some sleep.
Why are you so secretive?
You've got a pretty good memory.
I remember meeting you before.
You don't know us.
I got married three years ago.
I said nothing about the matter.
I bought a new sewing machine.
I just dropped in to say goodbye.
Tom got married to a widow.
Why was everybody yelling at you?
We're your friends.
This annoys me.
Will the work be finished by tomorrow?
That is a mistake.
I knew it would happen.
How are you?
You're reliable.
I want you to drop it.
The radio is on.
There were survivors.
Is your mother at home?
Is that the train I have to take?
The ground is still wet.
"May I call you tonight? ""Sure."""
That's the way he likes it.
We were in love.
He felt ill at ease.
Do you know her?
What's the target?
I have met neither of his sons.
It wasn't much of an earthquake.
Whose glasses are these?
Would you mind closing the door?
All the players were in position.
Fishing is not allowed here.
Tom had his wife Mary followed by a private detective.
Can we get on with it?
You need a keycard to open the door.
I have some money with me.
Everybody needs to do that.
You are the chosen one.
You're still young and healthy.
He has a short attention span.
I have too many things on my mind these days.
This company uses cheap labor to increase its profit margins.
I want to go.
I'm sorry to be so late. The meeting completely slipped my mind.
Tom is studying.
Are you ready to do that?
This isn't enough.
Just give me what I want.
Tom was in high spirits.
I haven't the foggiest idea.
He often suffered from toothaches.
I want to give you some money to help you through these hard times.
I don't feel well today and prefer to stay at home.
Some non-native speakers think they speak the language better than native speakers.
"What are you trying to hide? ""Nothing."""
Tom offered me a piece of cake.
The dictator came to power fifteen years ago.
We should ban advertising aimed towards children.
The pain is getting worse.
The new tax law is full of loopholes.
He gave me all the money he had on him.
You're the only person I know that can't swim.
I was born and raised here.
I'm a French teacher.
I've never seen you like this.
I had to change the plan.
I can't get her out of my mind.
I don't think that you need to do that.
Tom and Mary broke up last week.
You must hand in your homework by Thursday without fail.
You must be exhausted.
Could you read this for me?
This is getting tiresome.
I knew this day was going to come.
Tom just got married.
I can't share that information with you.
Maybe that's a good idea.
I think he's going to be sick.
Tom thanked everyone for waiting.
They're waiting for you.
Why didn't you dance with him?
There's a book about dancing on the desk.
We should do that together.
This tea smells good.
How do you calculate the volume of a cube?
What a sad thing to say.
She always smiles at me.
Tom is eating breakfast right now.
May I take a bath?
She refused to accept the post.
He took a photograph of the family.
When did you get back from Boston?
I've been trying to make an effort to come here more often.
They dug through the mountain and built a tunnel.
My business is prospering.
I went to the bank to take out money.
This should be illegal.
Tom doesn't smile often.
You've run out of things to drink.
Tom knows who we are.
I think Tom is lying.
That was a test.
This book is full of errors.
They said yes.
He was suspended from school for a week for bad conduct.
He's three years older than she is.
That's not our only problem.
I'm going to tell you what I think.
Tom stepped on the rake.
He dedicated his life to helping the poor.
Do you really think Tom was mistaken?
Tom takes the kids to the school every day.
I seem to have a fever.
His novel is beyond my comprehension.
I read The New York Times.
I can't let you.
Will the work be finished by tomorrow?
She smiled and said goodbye.
They know your name.
How did we get into this situation?
You can fix all this.
I will try.
All of them were handmade things.
I hope the weather will be fine tomorrow.
I hope you understand that.
You should take the appropriate measures at the appropriate time.
I don't see why everyone thinks this book is so good.
I cannot lend this book to you.
Tom was a brave soldier.
I never liked school.
Where did you buy this guitar?
I thought you'd want to see this.
You need to do more research.
It is essential that every child have the same educational opportunities.
I'll put in a word for you.
Tom refuses to take orders from Mary.
A majority of students dislike history.
Tom told me that he wasn't afraid of Mary.
Do you go running every day?
This isn't the right way to do this.
She is very thoughtful and patient.
I want to sign the contracts.
My parents were proud of me.
Don't act like you don't know what's wrong.
These flowers are from our garden.
We might die.
I know how they did it.
I'm going to do that in the morning.
Who designed the White House?
Is everybody having a good time?
Is that really appropriate?
You won't be needing that again.
You can't do it by yourself.
Tom tried to leave.
A lot of houses were washed away by the flood.
"What day is today? ""It's Monday."""
The insulin was making her fat.
I think you need to leave now.
I went to Boston to visit Tom.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
I couldn't finish it.
He works on the farm from morning till night.
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong.
Would you care to come and see me on Saturday?
You've been suspended.
I have nothing particular to do.
Enjoy your day.
I want to know how he manages to make such good use of his time.
He was accused of evading tax.
Tom slept in the basement of his store.
Whatever you say.
I caught an awful cold.
You did an excellent job.
Where do you have pain?
He can swim fast.
Basketball is a lot of fun.
Take a few days off.
I like fishing.
There may be others.
We should have gotten married.
She gave him something cold to drink.
She hurt her elbow when she fell down.
I learned that when I was a kid.
We don't want them to decrease our paycheck.
Tom could face life in prison.
My alarm clock didn't work. That's why I was late.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
That's a really shallow thing to say.
There's a peacock in the courtyard.
This is just what I wanted.
Don't take everything so literally.
The train was delayed for an hour.
Don't lean against this wall.
It has nothing to do with luck.
She wrote a lot of poems.
He saw the girl.
I want for you and me to be happy.
Tom's healthy.
I know how badly you want it.
I didn't catch what you said.
I'm finicky.
I showed my room to Tom.
You have a very impressive resume.
Tom is walking his dog.
I did my homework yesterday.
Didn't you know that oil floats on water?
You have to be patient.
I must admit that I don't like contemporary music much.
Let's stop here.
This painting is a forgery.
You're just a boy.
Tom paid for it all.
No one is listening to me.
I finally gave up smoking.
I just panicked.
She pulled him out of the mud.
He looked well.
A watched pot never boils.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
Click here for more information.
Could we have a table in the non-smoking section?
He's ashamed of his body.
You're a winner.
I just want to say good luck.
I go where I'm told to go.
Please bring the others.
I'm just getting back to basics.
I don't know how to do that yet.
Stop doing that.
I'm doing pretty well.
He was a real drunkard.
Playing tennis is his hobby.
Fruits have seeds in them.
Tom went back into his office.
Snow covered the bus.
What time did you close the store last night?
I've been waiting for you for 5 hours.
How much did you pay for that?
Both teams are unbeaten.
They don't want Tom back.
I'm glad Tom was able to see you while you were in Boston.
Solve the problem.
He is married with two children.
I'm not allowed to help you.
Do you like playing sports?
How many books do you think you have read so far?
Tom is my father's friend.
He had a lot of work to do.
He forgot to turn off the light.
What kind of music did you listen to when you were a teenager?
I hear some screaming.
I assure you that I can do that.
Tom was able to help Mary.
Don't be so outraged.
I'm not feeling very hungry right now.
Be more flexible.
The company released a press release.
It's sometimes difficult to control our feelings.
I want you to come back.
Tom is good at fixing watches.
I thought we were best friends.
I hit him on the chin.
Hand over your weapons.
I just can't believe my eyes.
I'd like to lie down.
It will be difficult for him to get up so early.
She has been unhappy since her cat died.
I'm humming.
How do you know so much about it?
I should've gone home.
How long did that take?
I refused to be paid.
She went outside to get a breath of fresh air.
I was tired from doing my homework.
Every man has his own strong points.
I might be back before you leave.
It was a big one.
I'm expecting a letter from her.
There's a problem.
You must do as I tell you.
I said exactly what they wanted to hear.
I got what you asked for.
Don't you have any will power?
I should've known better.
Tips are not accepted.
Tom has a family to think about.
You don't have to apologize.
You can't have both of those.
Wait till six.
I am very happy to hear about your engagement.
He lived a happy life.
We ran off 50 copies of the invitation.
I like running in the rain.
We finally arrived at the lake.
She put on socks.
Tom handed Mary a banana.
Tom is an orphan.
He was lucky.
Tom didn't help me.
He knows the truth.
How much do you love Tom?
I doubt that's what really happened.
Don't read my journal.
They are artists.
I have some very bad news.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
She is very wise.
Do you know how long they have been married?
I never saw Tom again.
There are frequently earthquakes in Japan.
Am I going to die?
Where's the source of this river?
Avoid it at all cost.
He is likely to win the game.
My son came to see me from time to time.
There was a list of available candidates.
I've had a wonderful time here.
Let's eat sushi.
It's a vague story.
It doesn't matter.
I don't think there's anything we can do.
I could kiss you.
You can't wear that.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
Tom looked.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
I've never liked this.
I don't speak your language.
She was perfect.
It is dangerous to ride a motorbike without a helmet.
I found it necessary to get assistance.
Tell me what I should be watching for.
Tom looked over the documents carefully.
I haven't said yes yet.
I'll do the best I can.
I just don't want to talk to you.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
I knew all along that Tom wasn't telling the truth.
She wept bitterly.
They said it's OK.
I know that you can do it.
That job is impossible for me to do.
I'd prefer a brown one.
They have come.
You could've ruined everything.
Get out of my sight.
I really appreciate the offer.
Is it time you need?
India gained independence from Britain in 1947.
Did it go well today?
The bar was so smoky that my eyes started to sting.
The tines of the fork are bent.
I want to know where you heard that.
He works the night shift.
I did it against my will.
She has some literary talent.
You should never have done that.
One of the girls was left behind.
What's all the hurry?
She burst into the room.
They each received a present.
Don't call him names.
What a nerve!
To learn a foreign language requires a lot of time.
He's aware of his own faults.
You're mistaken. That's not what I said.
This can't happen again.
There is no more cheese left.
She told me that I could sleep on the sofa.
It was his bicycle that was stolen.
He was ignorant of the fact.
I know that you don't like me.
Let them do their job.
My father doesn't waste his time.
The mouse was lured into the trap by a big piece of cheese.
We need exercise.
Let's go tell the others.
Thanks for showing me how to do this.
How dare you say such a thing!
We're going to have a test today.
Tom was clean-shaven.
He went to London two years ago.
I ought to have consulted my parents on the matter.
He lived abroad for many years.
I'm really shocked.
I joined the army.
Tom was reading a book.
She's smart and beautiful.
Do you have any beer?
I thought that you'd come today.
No one warned us.
These books are all mine.
He has earned a lot of money.
Tom won't leave early.
The water is deepest here.
We think we are over the worst.
You're a child.
I'm really proud of you.
I guess not.
I'll give Tom whatever he wants.
I don't get many visitors.
Everything we've told you is true.
I don't know why you don't like him.
The lamb was cooked perfectly.
How's your wife doing?
That's not really necessary.
I thought it was lunchtime.
Nice seeing you!
Half of the bananas in the basket were rotten.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Our hens laid a lot of eggs yesterday.
You are very courageous.
Did you tell Tom?
Perhaps we should discuss this later.
Tom can't tie his own shoes.
I had a strange dream last night.
You're invited.
They just wanted to ask me a few questions.
You're very brave.
I know how to use this.
I do think it's possible.
She advised him to do more exercise.
We invited him to our house.
This telephone is out of order.
Who gave you that package?
I'm going to stay there for about a week.
I want your love.
I'm not feeling quite up to par.
When do you want to eat?
They are my friends.
I realize it's probably too late.
Can't you just leave me alone?
Tom spilled some wine on his shirt.
Can you whistle?
I can't eat that food.
The water pipe burst.
Tom cut down the tree with his chainsaw.
I told you it was going to be easy.
I'm not old.
It's hard to understand his ideas.
It was truly a miracle.
A lot of people applied for the job.
I am not used to staying up late at night.
This book hasn't yet been translated into French.
I wrote a long letter to her.
I still have some work to do.
That was mentioned.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Things are improving.
You've failed.
I'll introduce you to the team.
I got the impression you didn't believe Tom either.
I read somewhere that short people need more sleep than tall people.
Did you do this all yourself?
I have enclosed your order form.
I want to be very clear about that.
I'd like you to leave immediately.
This tea is really sweet.
I play tennis an hour a day.
Your singing would put a professional singer to shame.
I want to take this with me.
He went out in the rain.
That's really important for me.
You're good with kids.
I have enough money to buy it.
Is it your helicopter?
I like your profile picture.
This candy costs eighty cents.
Don't you see what's happened?
I'm not particularly worried.
Where did you get that piece of wire?
I have misjudged you.
Sign on this line.
What you are saying does not make sense.
Chimpanzees can throw stones when they feel threatened.
I think you should grow a beard.
I haven't had dinner.
Do you really want Tom to leave?
I want to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
That vending machine is out of order.
Keep a low profile.
How did you lose it?
It makes no difference who I meet.
I don't remember that happening.
I say that all the time.
What is the language spoken in Brazil?
I've done a really stupid thing.
You can't just walk in here and start dictating policy.
I get the idea.
Tom would agree to do that.
Think before you act.
My parents are in Australia.
That doesn't sound too dangerous.
This book is worth reading.
Tom peeked inside.
Let go of my arm.
It's almost six.
Do you have a cellphone?
I'm going to see him tomorrow.
Tom is just a little bit shorter than Mary is.
I don't see any blood.
Where's the honey?
May I accompany you to the airport?
He made up a pretext for a fight with me.
I always tell the truth.
Why is my sister so mean to me?
My grandfather is very hard to please.
Please turn out the light so that I can sleep.
I have a new girlfriend.
There are some differences between British English and American English.
What was your favorite book when you were a child?
Tom doesn't drink beer at home.
I missed you today.
This is not my specialty.
People have eaten with their fingers from the beginning of history.
I remember that feeling.
When will you return my book to me?
We're both teachers.
I shouldn't eat food that has sugar in it.
What kind of man are you?
What were the meetings like?
That's the problem we have to solve.
I want to shake your hand.
I wouldn't have made it without you.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
The dog is asleep.
I shrugged.
Do you have a camera?
It's hard to take you seriously.
Probably the reason Tom can't go is because he doesn't have any money.
That's all that matters now.
Is that what you were talking about last night?
How can I become rich?
I know you want to help him.
That was a pretty good move.
You made a fool of yourself.
Wouldn't you like to drink some tea?
It doesn't look right.
I don't feel like studying at all tonight.
May I borrow your knife?
This is awesome.
You shouldn't have come here to begin with.
I was hoping you'd know.
We need some more water.
I can't send you all the files at the same time.
It had started to rain.
Tom should be ready by now.
The room was so dark that we had to feel our way to the door.
Plastic bags are bad for the environment.
I knew they were your friends.
I need you for just a second.
She put some of the ointment on her hands.
May I have the key?
Teach me how you do that.
Let me help.
It's easy to fall into bad habits.
Bring wine.
You're not as smart as me.
How tall you are!
We all know Tom can't swim.
I'm falling in love with you.
I need a red pen.
His success was largely due to good luck.
That's all I knew.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
I know you like chocolate.
Can you identify them?
I'll tell you what you want to know.
He died before I arrived.
There is a limit to everything.
I'm going to lock the door.
You will be better off buying a new one than trying to fix it.
No words can relieve her deep sorrow.
Tom is his brother.
You should start as early as possible.
We have to do that this week.
I appreciate what you did earlier.
I concentrated my attention on the lecture.
You may choose whichever you want.
We need something to eat.
You promised me that you would make something for us to eat.
Can I tell them you'll be visiting?
Let's talk soon.
I don't believe that Tom is guilty.
I had an argument with Tom about the use of marijuana.
We must pay the tax.
Don't take it so personally.
He was constantly borrowing money from me.
What do you think about it? It'd be great!
Will you have some coffee?
I don't think I can make it to your party.
Why's everyone staring at me?
My favorite TV show's been canceled.
The army forced him to resign.
We'll see you next Monday.
67% of those who never smoked said they worried about the health effects of passive smoking.
Do you let your children drink coffee?
That's all going to change.
He is good at gymnastics.
We have an obesity problem in this country.
He can swim a mile.
Both Tom and Mary have a car.
They are reading their book.
We turned the offer down.
She is distantly related to him.
I never saw you.
How do you know who I am?
I didn't expect you.
I like skipping rocks.
My father encouraged me to study the piano.
Don't make such careless mistakes.
This is such a waste of time.
I thought you were right.
They weren't able to agree on anything.
What do you want now?
Tom despises people who lie.
I don't usually eat at places like this.
It is really nice of you.
I love this album.
When did all this happen?
You don't know how much I love you.
We're conscientious.
Are you through with the newspaper?
Don't throw away this magazine.
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
Why are you out of breath?
I must know the truth about him.
Please show me your notebook.
There is no shortage of ideas.
I want to talk with you.
They put off their departure due to the heavy snow.
I know I can go faster.
I was able to do it.
The curtains were all open.
Is the university's library open now?
We all know Tom.
I have a vague recollection.
I used to be fat like you.
I work for an oil company.
Business is looking up.
She is old enough to travel by herself.
My father died before I got my diploma.
Tom says he's having trouble coping with the stress.
This is not my first time riding a bicycle.
What's the catch?
The fishermen took photos of their catch.
She did not walk to the gym.
I can't remember how to spell her name.
Are you enjoying this?
The girl let the bird go.
You're the teacher.
I just have a few questions.
It is going to be quite cold.
I go to school only three days a week.
How do you become rich?
Nobody likes my country.
I wish I had wings to fly.
We want you to take it.
Tom's reply surprised Mary.
Do you want your old job back?
Can you tell us how that'll work?
Is there life on other worlds?
We have to clear the snow off the roof.
I have no time for games.
I can't believe I really did that.
I told them what I thought of their plan.
I know that Tom can do that today.
Tom and Mary have three daughters.
We just want to be together.
I have no food.
I know that you trust Tom.
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars?
Where's the money I gave you?
Why did you come early?
Do you really think Tom will do that?
Tom and Mary were talking in French.
Don't be so childish.
How would you reword this sentence to make it sound more natural?
I want to talk to you alone.
Why do women hate you so much?
I can ask Tom to help.
Tell us where Tom is.
You crossed the line.
If only you'd thought of that before shooting your big mouth off.
We're going to need water.
Out of my way!
I have no interest in putting my money into your dreams.
I'm going to need some more time.
Who's your oldest friend?
You might be interested in this.
This seat is taken.
Are you finished?
I brought you red roses.
He's waiting for you at home.
I used to be fat like you.
The U.S. Department of Health says people should exercise at least two and a half hours a week.
Will you have a little time this weekend to help me with my French?
It was only much later that I came to understand the importance of child education.
Tom wore goggles.
You should always do your best.
The small dog crossed the road.
I immediately built a fire.
It's as easy as that.
It's a town in the middle of nowhere.
I'm glad I have a friend like you to confide in.
Tom learned to ski on his own.
Really?
He said we must keep the secret.
We prefer to stay here.
I booked a seat.
The police are after you.
Why don't you take the day off?
We have a stressful day ahead of us.
He turned the key.
She always buys milk.
I suspect you're right.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
I'm going to sell my car.
It is what I would do.
Tom had to make a fire.
That's all we know.
That was a foolish decision.
We differed as to the solution to the problem.
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.
Your daughter overheard us talking.
I'm going to tell Tom that.
I had a nagging sensation that I'd seen him somewhere before.
I'll fix a drink.
They made fun of my clothes.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
He works like a maniac.
Strive to be happy.
Would you like to see your husband grow a beard?
Tom is presumptuous.
I would like to see my father.
It seems like you're in a bad mood this morning.
I thought we were going to win.
I had to see you.
Tom has a large gun collection.
Tom told me he'd do that soon.
Is it a social problem?
What do you have in your hand?
I don't believe that to be true.
Who invented the telephone?
They're going to find you.
A sleeping child looks like an angel.
Stay calm and do your best.
Where did you go for spring break?
He will get his job back at the next election.
She must have visited England last summer.
Anyone can do it.
They regarded the man as a danger to society.
My friend helped me.
Thank you for stopping by.
He doesn't have a sister.
Spring fever is not a disease.
I would like to know how you will proceed in this matter.
Tom's family is powerful.
Let's hope Tom can fix this.
Where's the oar?
Can you identify this?
Is he correct?
Would that really be so bad?
Where did you get the hat?
I've got to go now.
The twins are as alike as two peas in a pod.
I don't need your job.
How did you come by this painting?
I want you to love me for who I am.
It was black.
I liked having you here tonight.
She prefers beer to wine.
Are you ready to leave?
I don't know him.
The place was packed.
It was hot in the room.
I voted for myself.
She sat there in silence.
The clean towels are in the drawer.
It's common courtesy.
My right hand is numb.
I thought you might be interested in this.
Your skirt's on backwards.
What kind of fruit do you want?
Is your dog mean?
How do I get to the bus station?
You know very well how it happened.
I was kidnapped.
The soldiers opened fire.
He went out a few minutes ago.
The man must be insane.
How old are the children?
You're quite safe.
Do you know how to use this machine?
It's not a bad thing.
Do you have the time?
The temperature has been below freezing for several days.
Have you gone mad?
You're not bruised.
Everything is bad.
He is drunk.
Elephants are an endangered species.
You'll ruin everything.
Dogs are barking.
How did you know my name?
I was warned.
I don't know why you didn't tell the truth.
I can't do it alone. You have to help me.
I knew we were going to lose.
The knife is dull.
The soldiers had more powerful weapons.
She grows many kinds of flowers.
Are you going home by bus?
I'm way stronger than I used to be.
How do you know all that stuff?
Do you like this color?
The boy began to cry.
I'm not finished talking to you yet.
I'm out of breath.
The rumor that they would get married spread at once.
Keep the money in a safe place.
He may be jogging around the park.
A car has one steering wheel.
I was last.
I never could hide anything from you.
Tom got kicked by a horse.
Tom came here to study French.
Sometimes I have the impression that we'll never come to an agreement.
You are good.
You never told me you were married.
Everything's going to be all right.
When did I say that?
Don't look down on others.
Tom became extremely weak.
I don't know what's going to happen to you.
Taste this.
You don't have to be so formal.
I worked this morning.
Is this information correct?
This law only applies to foreigners.
Pandas are beautiful animals.
It is beyond my power.
You can rely on me.
We have to stay together.
It's not like the movies.
He shuddered with horror at the grisly sight.
What should we buy with this money?
No Canadians were injured.
I know what you mean.
It's across the street.
Tom only knows how to speak French.
I answered the phone.
I saw you yesterday.
Don't climb on the wall.
Are you sure they can do this?
Do you know how to unlock this door?
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
Does this ring a bell?
I don't want to listen to you.
I like pop music.
I'll show you later.
Please get this work finished by Monday.
Doing something only half-heartedly is the worst thing you can do.
I called you.
I think you ought to listen.
This is your fault.
I love that store.
She advised him to stop smoking.
We found the footprints in the sand.
We have no water.
I never was overweight.
He has already finished his work.
I want Tom to go get me something to eat.
There's no hope.
How can I get to the station?
Tom is a member of the SWAT team.
They are in favor of your plan.
What do you think of that?
I didn't want anyone to know I was here.
I work better under pressure.
No one recognized you.
I'd planned to go abroad.
Do you think it'll be easy to find the kind of job you want?
I'd like to borrow your car tomorrow.
What did you say his name was?
You're very forward.
I don't want to waste my time trying to do this again.
He fell in love with her.
His brazen act of defiance almost cost him his life.
I want everybody to go home.
My father doesn't drink too much sake.
Do you want something to read?
Don't let him do it by himself.
I know you must be afraid.
Don't worry about your family.
Tom was better.
No one is more determined than I am.
My grandfather used to say that.
How can we tell?
I was bored with his old jokes.
Anybody could do this.
Tom sent us Christmas presents.
We kept in touch.
I know her well.
We're getting married.
You've changed a lot.
He does not have any friends.
My father drives safely.
I have to finish what I started.
Don't mind me. Just keep doing what you were doing.
Did I leave my umbrella here?
Just give me the gun.
That's enough for now.
I can't be seen with you.
Take this.
You should know better than to talk back to your boss.
He told me he wanted to quit the company.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I was detained.
He's been sick in bed for four days.
No one knows the future.
Have a nice holiday.
I used to play tennis with him on Sunday.
She advised him to fasten his seat belt.
You can't quit now.
What songs are you going to sing tonight?
That was a nice speech.
Elves have pointy ears.
I lost three kilograms.
We haven't yet decided what to do tomorrow.
The storm didn't cause any damage.
She does nothing but complain.
She will give her picture to whoever wants it.
You're aggressive.
You're the laziest person I know.
This was no accident.
He's three years older than her.
I want you out of my office.
Mary is the kind of woman I like.
How long do I have to stay?
Tom gave in to temptation.
I don't ever want to see you again.
How often do you shave?
These mosquitos are eating me alive!
I wasn't home.
My grandfather no longer has a driver's license.
He always wears his school tie.
"The phone is ringing. ""I'll get it."""
I know the exact time when that happened.
It was very ugly.
The country is abundant in natural resources.
Tom said that wasn't the case.
I'm willing to cooperate.
Tom doesn't know how much time it'll take him to do that.
He was accused of theft.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
Don't follow me.
I know a lot of people who don't own cars.
Where's the nearest drugstore?
Don't worry. You'll make it.
You must start immediately.
Maybe she forgot my birthday.
That place is open to everybody.
I certainly have had great luck.
He came back home a while ago.
Aren't you embarrassed?
That's what you said last time.
Must this letter be written in English?
Straighten up.
I love challenging myself.
How am I supposed to dress?
Tell us all the gossip.
Do you really think I can do that?
I thought that you were smart.
I'm just lazy.
I hate it when there are a lot of people.
I forgot my password.
Whose is that notebook?
Don't leave your work half finished.
He moved the desk to the right.
I love my family.
You got it all wrong.
You wouldn't understand. It's a girl thing.
He whispered something to her.
Let's see if it really does happen.
That's totally justified.
Are you falling in love with me?
That's all I wanted to know.
I'll be back in two hours.
I've taken care of it.
I don't want you to do that.
Let's see how this works.
This place gives me a really bad vibe.
Keep away from the fire.
I didn't know you were so tired.
We did that yesterday.
Who is your English teacher?
A horse passed my house.
I think that's an exaggeration.
He went to the bank and changed his money.
They drive on the left in England.
Try to understand this.
I parked my car behind Tom's.
It is ten minutes before eleven.
Why should I wait?
Can I change the channel?
It's a waste of time to study when you're sleepy.
Don't you just love a mystery?
I don't fear death.
We didn't recognize each other.
My children wear out their shoes quickly.
He's got a rap sheet as long as my arm.
Advance two steps.
You've got to be kidding!
I know Tom is done.
That's your idea.
He claims that he is honest.
I forgot your number.
You'd be the one to know.
That child was left in the sun too long.
I have no idea what I should be doing.
You'll never leave this town.
What if I told you I really want to be a teacher?
Who knows that?
Tom was the one who planted these flowers.
A monument was erected in memory of the deceased.
My parents were furious.
This is giving me a headache.
I'll be very frank with you.
How about stopping the car and taking a rest?
He went fishing in a river near the village.
Tom said he didn't feel like dancing.
You have to resign.
I heard you made a big mistake today.
No one's convinced.
I'm going to live alone.
The fire was on the first floor.
I didn't mean it like that.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
We consider Tom honest.
The store might be closed already.
It's dangerous to cross the bridge.
My uncle said that he jogs every morning.
All roads lead to Rome.
Can I buy you another beer?
Thanks for helping.
Have you put on weight?
They have company.
I'll see you later.
Tom likes fishing.
Trees are planted along the street.
He has the habit of scratching his head.
No one voted against it.
Where did you put the book I was reading?
The weather outlook for tomorrow is not good.
It's important that you understand.
Tom said he enjoyed the show.
Green suits you.
Tom didn't have the courage to admit that he had made a mistake.
May I accompany you on your walk?
My greatest ambition is to be an opera singer.
Everyone seems tense.
I wanted to share it.
It's for my personal use.
I already did that.
Tom jumped off the diving board.
They believe in God.
Tom jumped back just in time.
That's my favorite shirt.
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
You don't have to wait until the end.
Perhaps we'll see each other again tonight.
I don't care what you think.
I'll help you to the best of my ability.
Tom doesn't want to see anybody today.
Tom has lots of friends in Boston.
Not everybody knows about my plan.
I couldn't hear what they were saying.
The telephone rang a few minutes later.
Does Tom plan to help us?
Please do not try this at home.
I'm not sweating.
That's not really enough.
Who are you supposed to be?
What time does it close?
Did you get the loan?
I love you both.
This is a small book.
She is often mistaken for her sister.
Your hand is as cold as ice.
I've always considered you a close friend.
I lit the match.
Everyone likes them.
Here's what you wanted.
I enjoy reading.
Perhaps there are other reasons.
Many students bought the book.
I want you to return to your seat.
I'm sending you a book.
I can ski.
Why did Tom want to talk to Mary?
Who did you talk to?
I feel safe.
How did you learn to cook so well?
Who developed it?
Nothing is happening.
Tom knows Mary is right.
He drives roughly.
This fish has a bad smell.
Don't you think it's time you left?
Few people know about the plan.
Air the futon.
It's time to go home.
I swear I will never do such a thing.
I'll think about it.
Stay in this room.
I don't know why we're so busy.
I hope you'll get well soon.
I have wine.
She came back before eight.
Tom's not the slightest bit interested in my suggestion.
You don't have to do this.
She is washing the car.
May I visit you tomorrow?
You should go to bed.
Germs can cause sickness.
The bus was full.
You've got a bright future ahead of you.
We want to negotiate.
Your mother loves me.
I don't know what I'm going to do with you.
I'd like to buy a house.
The fish smells bad.
I want a puppy.
Find yourself a decent suit.
I haven't sold one of those in weeks.
Read all the instructions carefully.
She shrieked.
We can't do that.
My son is taller than me.
I need to talk to you about an urgent matter.
Were you hurt?
I love the way you walk.
Did Tom know what to do?
How old is the universe?
Do I look pale to you?
Tom is wearing sandals.
I don't understand what the problem is.
I feel awful.
They have two daughters.
Tom lives 10 miles from the Canadian border.
He told me to meet him at the restaurant.
We're making progress.
It was a new experience for everyone.
You're not fit.
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk.
Do you have a cheaper room?
That's my car.
Is everything prepared?
You don't need me anymore.
I'm in love with Mary.
Stop treating me like a child.
Are you going to take part in the contest?
Should I make a cream pie or a pound cake?
I thought you said you worked here.
That's embarrassing.
He will be back in an hour.
That's a good picture of you.
Did you do that purposely?
Half the apples that Tom gave me were rotten.
How did you find us?
It's kind of embarrassing.
Everyone was silent for a minute.
She is helping him.
He likes hunting.
He's out of town.
He went skiing.
We're all proud of you.
There was a bridge across each river.
That was the first time I had ever driven a car.
The two of them were never to meet again.
It's high time you were in bed.
Those are your options.
Whose beer is this?
I'll take care of it tomorrow.
These are counterfeit.
Help me out here.
Have you made up your mind to become a teacher?
This is way better.
We can't do this without you.
I need your passport and three pictures.
I think nobody's home.
Do you think I should ask Tom for help?
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
Can you believe it? He's even lazier than me.
I want to see for myself.
What did they do yesterday?
You should have kept it secret.
I'm afraid of dogs.
They can do it.
That worked.
He attained his goal.
The rules are simple.
I wouldn't try that again.
It's completely natural.
I'm going to make some bread.
She managed to learn to drive a car.
She praised him for his honesty.
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
It kept raining for three days.
That's important.
He is impatient to see you.
No one is irreplaceable.
It's even worse than I thought.
Let's ask Tom why he was late.
Stop avoiding the question.
I want to stretch my legs.
I can't go any further.
Tom and I went to the same school.
We got along famously.
Tom has been married a long time.
Almost everyone believed the rumor.
What's making this sound?
I didn't actually think you'd agree.
I don't take vacations very often.
His aunt's apple pie was delicious and he had a second helping.
Your pen is better than mine.
Christmas is just around the corner.
I cut the paper with a pair of scissors.
No one seemed afraid.
You need to learn how to be assertive.
Which way should we go?
You've taught us a great deal.
Just wait a second.
I had some time to think.
Get in the boat.
Are we friends?
I feel very strongly about that.
I suppose you want to use my office.
Every mistake made me stronger.
I don't see any bruises.
There is no reason for her to scold you.
Whose idea was that?
He turned his back on the old tradition.
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.
Tom prepared a healthy meal for Mary.
I want you to lay back and relax.
I think there's somebody in the next room.
What makes you laugh?
I envy your good health.
You learn something new every day.
I don't feel like eating anything.
We have far better things to do with our time.
Not all people like dogs.
It wasn't luck.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
Is this man threatening you?
I know exactly what I should do.
No one expected him to be a candidate again.
Someone stole all my money.
Have another cup of coffee.
They love that song.
Why don't you stay with me for a few days?
He had a book in his hand.
Her argument was not based on facts.
I should've gone with Tom.
Is your family doing well?
I know that Tom isn't against it.
This should do the trick.
I'm sorry for calling so late. I just wanted to hear your voice.
How did you manage to do that?
I followed your instructions.
I didn't want to be seen.
I found out how to solve the problem.
Why did Tom call you?
There's no logical reason for this.
I'm not married.
I never have trouble falling asleep.
We're all a bit a scared.
We're fasting.
Tie your shoe.
You're in charge now.
I'm not overweight.
I just had a talk with your lawyer.
Make a prediction.
I'm glad you asked that question.
The man was arrested as a spy.
You're fortunate.
Did anyone see you there?
She's always busy on weekdays.
Tom took a twenty dollar bill out of his pocket.
I thought that was your job.
There's not much I can do for you now.
Promise me that you won't tell anyone.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.
That's really great.
Are you all completely crazy?
These hats are the same size.
Her friend is a singer.
I will call in order to confirm it.
They loaded the truck.
I wish I could live in a house like this.
I didn't know you had a cat.
You're talented.
I hear that there are people in Japan who keep penguins as pets.
I don't have any money.
Stop being so nice to me.
There must be something in there.
I managed to make myself understood in English.
He isn't actually the manager.
I didn't do anything to Tom.
I need some answers.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
Perhaps you should buy a gun.
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?
She's made up her mind and refuses to be talked out of it.
Would you like something to drink?
I'd like to sail around the world.
I'm the richest one here.
I need a concise explanation.
He is the man you met the other day.
There was a lot of snow last winter.
Your face is always dirty.
It is useless to try to remember all the words in the dictionary.
Tom can't do the job.
She is a better singer than any other student in her class.
I'm looking forward to the summer vacation.
He can't sing well.
Maybe we should go to Boston.
He didn't tell me everything.
Do you want to give it another try?
Let's go fishing.
I can't believe I listened to you.
I think they're ready.
Everyone is happy and healthy.
What's your motivation?
Have you finished writing that song you've been working on?
She advised him to go there alone.
It'll take some time to finish unloading the truck.
We pitched the tent next to the river.
I have nobody to play with.
I was so disappointed.
Why are there stars in the sky?
It's a beautiful sword.
I am proud to be a part of this project.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives.
She can swim further than I can.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
There was a lot of blood on the floor.
I hadn't considered that.
Can you pronounce these words?
That looks like it hurts.
Have I changed that much?
I'm a little disappointed.
This container is completely watertight.
There wasn't a soul in sight.
You don't have to pay.
I have been expecting you.
This school has no heating.
Both of my sisters are married.
I don't really have a family.
We were all on the bus.
What did you come here for?
The train is ten minutes behind today.
No one seems to care.
We're on our way.
Who is your favorite author?
There's more to it than that.
I apologized.
Tom owes Mary slightly over a thousand dollars.
I don't have much interest in cooking.
Tom is starved.
Tom heard a noise and went outside to see what it was.
Where did you put my umbrella?
I just want things to be normal.
Nothing will distract us.
Make me happy.
A young girl was at the steering wheel.
My father gave it to me when I was a kid.
I have a sore knee.
I think my German is really bad.
Please stop calling me that.
Tom hit a home run.
I've only just come back.
He thinks I'm jealous.
I wish that I could give you something.
Here's the tricky part.
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
Just ignore what Tom said.
He's now a college student.
He is careless about money.
You're fascinating.
The children love listening to fairy tales.
This is where the fun begins.
He is wearing gloves.
I was barely able to work.
This ticket is valid for three days.
I'm free every day but Monday.
She came close to drowning.
My father stopped drinking.
We just want Tom to keep working.
I was late.
I'm not always at home on Sundays.
Only you can answer the question.
All the desk drawers were empty.
You should take her advice.
Stop yelling!
Is that what Tom meant?
How much did they give you for your old car?
Do you want to come over tonight?
He caught a big one.
He doesn't read many newspapers.
You did that the wrong way.
I think he needs to go there.
He made it.
Tom has three older brothers.
I wish you'd told me that a bit earlier.
She introduced the lady to me.
I know what I'd do.
None of these eggs are fresh.
I think you like me.
Everything looked nice.
You won't be interested.
I must discuss that new plan with him.
Where did you hear this?
I want to live.
Don't leave town.
I just want a little more of that.
Let's clear this up right now.
What time will dinner be served?
My baby brother sleeps ten hours a day.
She has dry hair.
Life is short.
I want to know how you know that.
Why are you so jealous?
Don't give it a second thought.
What're we looking for?
This river is very deep.
Let go of the bottle.
I feel better than I did.
Did you take the money?
Look at the picture on the wall.
This is so dumb.
He has been busy since this morning.
A driver was sleeping in the car.
The pressure is getting to him.
We elected her mayor.
My girlfriend was crying.
I know you want to make me happy.
The suspect was holed up in an abandoned factory.
I can't tell you what we did last night.
She killed him with a knife.
He is a great scientist.
I suggest that we hold off on making a decision until all bids are in.
I have read three books since this morning.
Why would I know that?
You need to move on.
I thought you didn't want to go.
Tom will never believe me again.
Things got out of hand.
Put them on the table.
There are now three cars parked in front of your house.
This is child's play.
What if I asked you to stay?
Did you have fun last night?
I think that I understand what Tom's trying to say.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.
I didn't know what to say.
I was home all night.
I wasn't talking about Tom.
My short-term memory is getting shorter and shorter.
Tom met John in prison.
Ask if he wants another drink.
He is different from what he used to be.
Good eating habits are essential.
I'm now officially part of this group.
Don't you want everything to be perfect?
His pictures are very famous.
I hope that she will help me.
Are you all completely crazy?
Please drive safely.
I said he could go.
Is this fake?
Further testing is required.
They're in the garden.
They were attacked.
Are you doing all right?
It's getting late.
They love each other deeply.
This box is too heavy for me to carry.
I just can't help myself.
The boy enjoyed painting a picture.
She is quiet.
What are you writing?
Have you tried this before?
I smoke.
I never work during weekends.
This picture must have been taken in 1964.
It's a quarter to three.
Mother went shopping with my brother.
I'm too tired to swim.
He's very protective.
She didn't want him to go out with other women.
They forced me out.
I can't kiss you the way you want to be kissed.
Everyone got off the bus.
This work is simple enough that even a child can do it.
I don't feel like eating at all.
He selected a Christmas gift for her.
Where are your things?
It can be dangerous.
We buy stationery in bulk.
Can I call you back in twenty minutes?
He left the water running.
She also speaks French.
That really isn't what I meant.
I was just in time for the last train.
Tom abandoned that idea.
I cannot fix the computer.
This carpet is beautiful.
I'll be happy to help you.
She is not always late.
I think Tom may be hurt.
I want to work with you.
It never occurred to me that he loved me.
Tom doesn't like poker at all.
We must start at once.
I lost my balance.
That scenario is unlikely.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
A monument was erected in memory of the deceased.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
I was caught in a shower on my way home from school.
This is the bicycle I want.
That might not be possible.
I spend a lot of time reading.
They finished building the bridge on time.
I'd prefer to be at home.
The inspector arrived at the school late on Monday morning.
I'm not happy with my job.
She put lots of sugar in the coffee.
Times are changing.
Take me home.
I solved the problem.
I don't know the exact place I was born.
I'm not interested in politics.
I'm always forgetting people's names.
Is everyone here?
How could you do this to them?
Are you still jealous?
The cows were moving very slowly through the long green grass.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your help.
Do you want me to leave?
Do you eat breakfast at home?
He was angry with his daughter.
Tom was in a bad mood all day yesterday.
Why does Tom want to hurt me?
You can go wherever you want to go.
He sent the letter back unopened.
These people are professionals.
My friends invited me to supper.
I think that would be best.
I called her up.
You've got a pretty good memory.
Don't walk out on me again.
Tom ate more than I did.
Why would you want to be a teacher?
I explained to the host that I had been delayed by a traffic jam.
We all have our orders.
Be a man.
I just want you all to know you can depend on me.
California and Nevada border on each other.
I thought Tom must be mistaken.
We're behind schedule.
I've just returned from a trip.
Tom and Mary got married secretly.
They were enjoying themselves.
You seem a little depressed.
Does he like me?
You should have seen it.
Tom's not here.
I'll bring you the bill immediately.
We washed our feet.
"What were you two talking about? ""Nothing."""
You will be able to speak English.
You were my friend.
A true friend would not say such a thing.
I hope you're not planning to do that today.
Will he come this evening?
We need to minimize the risk of infection.
I didn't say I liked it.
Take off your hat when you enter a classroom.
He speaks too fast.
We were all at school together.
I should've never walked so much in a new pair of shoes.
We'll meet at my house.
Don't you see what's happened?
It sounds like a fun job.
I hate being alone this time of year.
Aren't you sleepy?
He used to be a quiet man.
The parking lot in the back of the school is almost empty.
You didn't tell me that you were a doctor.
I don't live with Tom.
He will arrive there about five o'clock.
We're going to have a good day.
I didn't want the story to end.
That made the problem all the more complicated.
I wanted to have a word with you about what happened.
She taught him the tricks of the trade.
Is it a yes or a no?
Tom disappeared into the crowd.
You are very rich.
You can sit down now.
It's an unusual name.
You have a very pretty name.
Tom only wears brand-name clothes.
I like to play music with Tom.
He hoped to succeed.
I'm no match for you.
I know you're not serious.
I couldn't lie to you.
Tom is determined to lose weight.
Tom wants to live in the country after he retires.
They kept talking all the time.
All the lights went out.
I want to apologize for the way I talked to you the last time we met.
I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
I feel like such an idiot.
They're in the hot tub.
I'm surprised that Tom can't speak French.
We don't want to cause any trouble.
There's something else I need to discuss with you.
I want to make something clear.
I never knew his first name.
The taxi picked up two passengers.
What happens if I press this button?
That's the one thing I'm sure of.
You seem confident.
Her sister looks young.
I'm willing to help you with your work.
That's not something I would joke about.
Am I the only one that sees the humor in this?
Can you stay for a few days?
Let's have a serious talk about your future.
You're too polite.
There is no going back.
They asked him.
You don't have the right.
I didn't know Tom had died.
Tell us about what you've been doing.
He got bored quickly.
There's nothing better than that.
"How old are you? ""I'm sixteen."""
My grandson is still a baby.
How do I get a hold of you?
It's nice of you to give me a lift.
I hope that she will get well soon.
Am I dying?
Are you the mayor?
No one will miss me.
I don't expect you to understand it.
I've been studying French for a very long time.
What time is brunch?
He discussed the problem with his son.
Several houses were washed away by the flood.
I don't need to tell you anything.
I don't know how you lasted five years in that job.
He is so honest that everybody trusts him.
It's good to talk to you.
Let's hope you're mistaken.
I was never in love with Tom.
Tom knows exactly how Mary feels.
I can't believe we're doing this.
I told Tom where I'd bought my hat.
I feel like throwing up.
This door will not open.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I think nobody's home.
I apologize for my rudeness.
I bathe every day.
I had to keep my secret.
He lives at the top of the hill.
We were almost run over by a truck.
What can you see?
Put the book on the bottom shelf.
I never thought I would have to support such a large family.
Who hired you?
I said he could go.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
Tell me everything you know.
Do we have a babysitter for tonight?
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Would you like to come to my party?
Can he see us?
You've got bags under your eyes.
He runs the business with his sons.
It's me that went there yesterday.
I'll get you a towel.
It's not here.
I'm healthy.
How could it not bother you?
I can't help but feel a little relieved.
I strongly advise you to use this.
We were in the living room when we heard the gunshot.
It's right.
It was gambling that brought about his ruin.
He told me to meet him at his apartment.
I'm still waiting for my order.
Where were you today?
What's the best sleeping position?
I'm not sure of anything.
She is always smiling.
It's all yours.
It was so hot that I thought I was going to pass out.
He is his own master.
I don't want to talk about that right now.
What's the name of that bird?
I don't really have a gun.
You saved my life.
I have to exercise.
We skipped his turn on purpose.
He is sitting on the chair.
Where did you get this information?
I just read about that in the newspaper.
They caught him playing a trick on his sister.
Just because something is more expensive doesn't mean that it's better.
No one seems to know what this is used for.
Ignore Tom.
I wish that I could believe you.
They danced until six in the morning.
I learned nothing new.
Do you have the vaccine?
I would appreciate a reply as soon as possible.
I hear she is going to get married next month.
These boxes are made out of plastic.
That toy is selling like hot cakes.
I'm left-handed.
That is very expensive!
You all did well.
They are jealous of us.
You're weak.
Living in a cluttered home is very stressful.
How did that happen?
Tom told Mary he had to talk to her.
Can I get you anything?
You scared the living day lights out of me!
Australia is no different.
I think we can handle that.
Are you a ghost?
I had too much to drink and I can barely walk.
Leave me alone.
He got lost on his way here.
I have already changed my clothes.
Tom had a five o'clock shadow.
I don't like your suggestion.
This picture was taken three years ago.
She came with good news.
I'd like to reserve a table for three.
My brother eats twice as much as I do.
Each one of us should do his best.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
She threw herself into my arms.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
You have no idea.
Our school is further away than the station.
Nature is cruel.
I didn't know this.
His debt came to 100 dollars.
I travel around a lot.
Let me introduce you to a good dentist.
You're diplomatic.
Germany has no minimum wage.
Are seats available?
I'm no longer groggy.
How long have you been playing the drums?
Nobody tells the truth anymore.
Tom intends to stay in Boston for three days.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
Let me handle this.
When do they need me?
How much money has been spent on building the museum?
Tom still isn't used to the way things work here.
We tried to warn them.
He has quite a few records.
I just got the news.
Did you do your homework?
You're not as smart as me.
What have we gotten ourselves into?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
I hope that's satisfactory.
The lid is closed.
This cake is for Tom.
Tell me again when the concert begins.
Which of you will try it first?
Why do you put up with that?
Your remark is irrelevant.
He's always at home on Sundays.
Everybody was silent.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
He doesn't have enough experience.
That sounds like a reasonable demand.
It was a busy night.
I lost my phone.
Forty people were present.
She is very cynical about life.
You have to stop drinking.
I want to do this alone.
She said that it might be true.
He played tennis all day long.
He sat on the bed.
They go to work on foot.
I had to climb over the fence.
Last night we worked until 10 p.m.
I want to keep one.
He can't be older than I am.
Who's playing hockey tonight?
Whose house is across from yours?
I've started bleeding.
Do you think those are real?
We're sunk.
I wasn't able to believe him at first.
I think we're too late.
Are you in good health?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Why aren't you all laughing?
They told me about it.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
When is your school festival?
A girl gave me an orange in exchange for a piece of cake.
The station is a three-minute walk from here.
Give me a hand with this.
I haven't eaten since breakfast and I'm very hungry.
My car is not running.
Why do you like Tom so much?
She caressed her baby lovingly.
I love the smell of pancakes in the morning.
I totally agree with you.
I made the best of my small room.
That would be very funny.
Mary is going to help us tomorrow.
My dog is dreaming of a cat.
How do we know this isn't a trap?
How many people can fit in your car?
I wish you the same.
I wonder what Tom would do in a situation like this.
I didn't want to waste it.
You're lucky that you have a job.
Are you sure you want to throw that away?
Swear you won't do that again.
Tom knew he was going to die.
Tom will say no.
Tom tried in vain to hide his pain.
You're very fortunate.
I didn't think anyone was home.
He completely failed to understand why she got angry.
They were all smiling.
We think that they know us.
The volcanic eruption threatened the village.
I'll take care of my parents when they get old.
You're probably tired after such a long flight.
Am I getting sloppy or what?
I want you to know that I meant every word I said.
Don't speak with your mouth full!
Are you kidding?
I go to the dentist every second day.
It seems very interesting.
Do you trust her?
We must go to school.
You did nothing wrong.
How stupid of me!
She has not come here yet.
I like the kind of music that Tom writes.
We have to be cautious.
His neighbors are suspicious of him.
You have to go the rest of the way without me.
I'm fearless.
I can't let you go in there alone.
She has forgiven him for everything.
Did you turn off the gas?
She stammers when she feels nervous.
Can you introduce me to a lawyer who speaks French?
I wonder what it is like to travel through space.
You're very lonely.
I used to think it didn't really matter what I fed my dog.
I know you want to help him.
Tom is used to staying up all night.
We have a bit of time now.
I don't want to hear this.
This is your chance.
How are you doing?
The lawn mower needs gas to operate.
It's easier than it sounds.
The terrible scene made him tremble in fear.
I really want a motorcycle.
I bought this for my boyfriend.
I enjoyed this book.
What are your plans for the night?
Getting married is a serious matter.
She wants to keep him at a distance.
We're on schedule.
I was alone.
I cough a lot.
I've seen a lot worse.
You are blinded by love.
It's already seven.
He examined the spare parts one after another.
I usually don't wear a tie.
We need a hero.
I was discouraged.
I can't bear the noise any longer.
I wanted to do that for you.
The police compared the fingerprints on the gun with those on the door.
Look out for rock slides.
I think you're jealous.
The contestants are gearing up for the final round of competition.
Let's sit here for a while.
Nobody knows it's my birthday today.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom has never stolen money his whole life.
Tom swam with the dolphins.
You're the only one I think about.
Have you ever been to America?
He comes to see me nearly every day.
Do you have enough?
I'll act on your advice.
Tom spoke French.
I always think of him when I'm alone.
The plane takes off at 8:00 a.m.
I want to make you happy.
Watch out!
He absconded with the money.
I think I understand what Tom's trying to say.
He's taking a shower.
Do you have a stopwatch?
I don't think they believe us.
We're expecting.
I can't help you today.
It doesn't fit well here.
What's the news?
He was exposed to danger.
There's no solution to this problem.
I didn't do anything.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
How did you get hurt?
Have you already met him?
I enjoy playing the blues.
Tom thinks I'm his enemy.
Is this your DVD?
Tom plays bass guitar in our band.
I'm making breakfast now.
He showed a lot of skill.
We're all dying.
Do you need anything else?
Tom's injuries aren't considered life-threatening.
I usually go shopping on Sunday afternoon.
Are you absolutely certain that's not going to happen?
They are both good.
People do that all the time.
He left his son a large fortune.
They're out to get you.
They were pretty tired after having worked all day.
I have every confidence in his ability.
Why don't you come visit us?
I bought shampoo and toothpaste.
We were all disgusted.
He adjusted the telescope to his sight.
He's likely to come.
Where did I put my coat?
I like your city.
It appears to me that you are right.
No one else knows how to do it.
I've got you.
Why do you want to know what I'm thinking?
Do you mean you don't find that odd?
Prices have jumped.
Is that really what you think?
I love the way you talk.
You must be more polite.
Tom says that he's in love with Mary.
Sorry to disturb you.
We're deluding ourselves.
He had his car stolen in that parking lot.
May I borrow your dictionary?
I'm good at skiing.
You've parked in my space.
Some people believe they can become rich without having to work.
He is not as tall as his father.
The earth is a lot larger than the moon.
The table in that room is very nice.
Who can be calling me at this hour?
Don't ask any questions.
He doesn't get jokes.
She's my older sister.
That's too easy.
How long does it take to walk to your house from here?
She put me in a delicate situation.
You have changed a lot.
How do you prefer your eggs?
I'm sorry if I scared you.
I'm not sure how we can make that happen.
We just want a second opinion.
Tom remembers you.
She went with him.
It's not my fault.
I can't attend today's meeting.
Tom wanted to hire us both.
I imagine Tom will be a finalist.
May I turn on the television?
I don't think that'll be necessary.
Take the road on the right.
I'm not amused.
I really like this album.
I ate too much.
Anger showed on his face.
I'm proud of my father.
Are you sure they can do this?
I don't think it's safe to go out at night by yourself.
I thought Tom was Canadian.
Who recommended that?
I don't have to listen to this.
I have been to the station to see him off.
I know I'm not the brightest girl in the world.
They were put in prison.
I cannot possibly do it.
Tom prepared a healthy meal for Mary.
Where did you go to college?
That's exactly what you need now.
This is my favorite pair of shoes.
Is this the first time you've eaten Japanese food?
I don't deserve to be this happy.
She's waiting for you at home.
Tom is an intern.
I will never see him.
Can we come with you?
I look forward to hearing from you.
I think about it every day.
I've only done this once before.
Who are you waiting for?
Would you work for minimum wage?
You have good reason to be angry.
We're quite alone.
Be sure to put out the fire before you leave.
Tom is learning programming.
He did a good job.
I need water.
I owe you nothing.
They were forced to withdraw.
Why don't you try and get some sleep?
He's self-employed.
Act your age.
I'm worried that I'll get lost.
He is tired from overwork.
I did what I thought I should do.
There seem to be lots and lots of stars.
I'm learning French.
Had you been drinking?
She keeps her diary in English.
She trusted you.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
We walked up and down the streets of Kyoto.
Are you in good health?
Everyone started arguing.
Let me borrow that.
I'll explain later.
I've already had a coffee.
I heard my name called.
What are you two doing?
I heard what you were saying.
They said you were fired.
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon.
How would you describe yourself?
The dentist gave me some pills for my toothache.
What was your favorite book when you were a child?
We'll give it back.
Wash your hands well.
Would you mind waiting another ten minutes?
It's OK with me if it's OK with you.
This book is only published in French.
I got paid today.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Perhaps that's true.
Tom isn't good at hiding his emotions.
I've got to leave early.
We're alone.
I'll be careful with the kids.
I've said I'm sorry.
They might be taller than you.
There is an urgent need for teachers with science backgrounds.
Is the plane on schedule?
It's junk. Throw it away.
I'd like to sing you a song.
What do you think of that?
They're staring at you.
I'm skinny.
Why not break the door down?
I don't want to study today.
I recommend that restaurant.
I find this disgusting.
I worry about my future.
He kept talking.
I am saving money in order to buy a new personal computer.
I've made peace with my maker. I'm ready to die.
Bread is made from wheat.
Can you guess the price?
He has a new woman in his life.
Bees provide us with honey.
Have you said anything about this to Tom?
You'll have to wait at least an hour to get a ticket.
He's not going to visit you tomorrow.
We'll have to see what's doable.
What I'm about to say is strictly between you and me.
Do you want to make a deal?
That pasture is ten acres.
Tom didn't answer the phone.
I forgave you a long time ago.
I saddled the horse myself.
We'll let you know the result within a week.
I think that's just what I need right now.
I have been wearing this overcoat for more than five years.
Tom tripled his investment in six months.
Tom didn't find anything.
Raise your hand if you have a question.
Your question has no answer.
Run!
There's only room for one.
She usually walks to school.
I make it a rule to take a walk every morning.
He became brave in the face of danger.
Do you have the same thing in a different color?
What did he look like?
I just got your email.
She took the taxi to the museum.
That was very frustrating.
I'm really hungry. I haven't eaten all week.
He is the stingiest person I know.
I did it anyway.
I am well acquainted with the subject.
There is an urgent need for understanding how climate change will affect our lives.
He hit his head on the shelf.
Do you want me to leave the light on?
I like the way you think.
You'll find out soon enough.
I had to walk here because my car broke down.
I've got to tell someone.
I went to the market.
I grew up in that neighborhood.
Your mother is anxious about your health.
I have as many books as Tom does.
I've got to leave soon.
Does the price include breakfast?
I haven't heard that joke in a long time.
Tom was stabbed in the chest.
I wanted to think about it.
The smell is persistent.
There's nothing more we can do for Tom.
He seems to be involved in that matter.
Why is Tom studying French?
Tom wasn't allowed to do that.
Do you have Japanese newspapers?
I hear that he eats frogs.
I want to live in a small town.
You have to pay taxes.
Why are they protesting?
Why are you even here?
I'm looking for my shoes. Have you seen them?
You're perfectly right.
It's only a book.
I've ruined everything.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
I felt guilty about it.
How are your parents?
He asked his wife if she was coming with him.
I thought that I saw a rabbit on the road.
I don't want to listen to you.
Tom asked if you'd be there.
They adopted the orphan.
I have an appointment this morning.
I've had enough of your excuses.
His advice counted for little.
I don't think that anybody really understands me.
I don't care what you do with it.
The man looked at me.
Don't let him know the truth.
He doesn't have any children.
What'll they do to Tom?
I prefer to do it by myself.
I don't have strep throat.
Who's after you?
You won't find anything here.
You can't kill us all.
I want to make my parents proud.
Some of you already know me.
The US is trying to extradite a drug lord from Mexico.
Where are we going next?
Fewer and fewer people are working to support more and more people living on government benefits.
They asserted that it was true.
I suppose Tom told you what time he plans to arrive.
I did you a favor.
What a pleasant surprise!
Let's try to be discrete about this.
You just need a change of scenery.
You run very fast.
You may need a shovel.
How often do you feed the fish?
Why didn't you turn up on Saturday?
Are you our enemy?
He left immediately.
I'm not afraid of death.
Tom is a black belt in karate.
We're retiring.
We'll dance.
I tried to write with my left hand.
I don't like this soup.
I am sorry that my friend is not here.
That's very kind of you.
Keep this.
The train arrived on time.
Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
Do you know how this works?
We want to talk to Tom.
Do you feel lucky?
I like dark red better.
I admit that I was wrong.
You're crafty.
I'm glad you could make it.
It took me more than a week to put the model ship together.
Promise me one more thing.
Is that so bad?
She runs a dance studio.
I don't like feeling so powerless.
Tom attempted to persuade Mary to go to church with him.
That's one of ours.
I'm glad we did that.
I want to know the truth about my son's death.
These are the people who live next door.
Tom is making soup.
I know how to play soccer.
She played the piano with enthusiasm.
Never make the mistake of arguing with people for whose opinions you have no respect.
It's making me nervous.
It's the dynamic interaction between the characters that makes this novel so great.
My parents sent me to fat camp when I was thirteen.
This is a book about England.
You're the only person I know who can probably answer this question.
I'm still not buying it.
Did you get my email yesterday with the instructions?
He hit his head against a rock.
He hates shopping.
I only went inside once.
I took him a cup of coffee.
I didn't know you were so ambitious.
I told you this is where we'd find Tom.
The pain has mostly gone away.
Ten years have passed since he died.
I arrived yesterday.
He was walking in front of me.
I don't like the ocean.
He doesn't tan.
Did you like the movie?
How do you know how deep the lake is?
Her face suddenly turned red.
You party too much.
I love my yellow sweater.
It's like one of those.
You might be the only one here who can do that.
What could they possibly want from us?
We saw a stranger walking outside.
Are you alone?
That was very good.
I wanted the best.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted him to walk her home.
Mothers should keep their children from playing in the streets.
Get out of my seat.
Tom thought Mary would be late.
You're probably tired.
Maybe it was a cat.
That sounds very interesting.
Can I get you something to drink?
You're my kid's teacher.
It took me a long time to do my homework last night.
You must think I'm a complete idiot.
I dropped my phone.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Who will you be coming with?
It was the best night of my life.
This isn't funny.
Hippopotamuses are agressive and unpredictable.
He saved money for his old age.
What happened to your car?
I'm too scared to think.
She is no less beautiful than her mother.
Nobody can believe in you more than yourself.
A passport is something you cannot do without when you go to a foreign country.
We were just about to leave when she telephoned.
He will be missed.
You knew I was married.
It's all yours.
I can't depend on you anymore.
The news spread like wildfire.
Tom rode his bicycle down a quiet residential street.
She needed the entire afternoon to complete the work.
Tom handed the key to Mary and she opened the door.
I wish we had made more progress.
You don't seem too worried.
Is that milk still good?
I'm as shocked as you are.
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help.
They all looked happy.
Can you tell me a little about yourself?
He stood at the end of the line.
Don't call me a jerk.
He tried to kill himself.
He is much older than he looks.
I wonder if they'll get divorced.
It's not possible.
My parents had an arranged marriage.
I'd like to get the meeting started.
Let's have a minute of silence.
I don't want to hear another complaint about you.
I stopped smoking.
I'll call you later today.
Six plus four equals ten.
It's hard to do.
Tom is not as patient as Mary.
Are you sure you want to put your life in her hands?
I like mathematics.
We all sang in unison.
That was unnecessary.
The whistle of the steam train woke us at daybreak.
Tom stopped Mary.
We must separate politics from religion.
I never thought I'd ever see you again.
He likes jelly.
She unbuttoned her shirt.
He found out the secret.
Meet me at the hotel bar.
I hope that you aren't afraid.
You're out of luck.
You're far too young to be doing this.
I still have a few options.
They cannot be saved.
Tom did all he could do to help.
Look at those black clouds.
It's got to be now.
Mary hugged her doll.
It's up to you to decide what to do.
His argument was logical.
I sure miss my friends.
Tom was caught selling drugs to kids.
I'll be happy to answer your question.
I thought you understood that.
He thinks that she will leave.
There's nothing you can do about that.
This is your last opportunity.
Where did you find the keys?
Tom banged his head on a tree branch.
I have a fever and I ache all over.
It's one of the basic human instincts.
Have you ever been on TV?
What are the terms of the contract?
How deep?
Don't you think you ought to write them a thank-you note?
We're crazy about each other.
I want you to do something about it right away.
Tom and Mary spent the night out under the stars.
I couldn't prevent Tom from leaving.
Let's go by train.
I came here when I was four.
Maybe Tom should quit before he hurts himself.
I failed the test because I didn't study.
Both Tom and Mary didn't know how to send a fax.
They stopped laughing.
She forced him to do it.
French is not only spoken in France.
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
I don't think that's possible.
I like your hat.
I can feel it.
I'm shooting.
Who baked this cake?
I can't go out because I have a lot of homework.
Is it fatal?
The beds are uncomfortable.
What did you make?
The car didn't move.
Do you feel like eating something?
It was last year.
He came out on top.
I didn't expect you.
Tom didn't know where to park his car.
I take a walk with my dog in the evening.
They are eating their apples.
Tom knew all that.
How much are we short?
It's just not fair.
When did you quit smoking?
I caught a carp.
Let's be honest with each other.
The governor was surprised by the commission's response.
I'm on strike.
He zones out in front of the TV for hours on end.
Have you read this book?
You don't have to explain.
She doesn't like sushi.
I don't know what that word means.
It looks like he might win first prize.
How did Tom get caught?
You're the one who trained me.
There's always a first time for everything.
He slowly let the clutch out and drove off.
Look out for pickpockets.
She works with single-minded determination.
Tom makes a lot of spelling mistakes.
Don't insult my intelligence.
We don't want to take the time now.
She would often come late for school.
This is the best seafood restaurant in the neighborhood.
I have a visa.
Don't think about that anymore.
Tom's homeless.
We've been warned.
I'm invited to a party tonight.
Shouldn't you be at school already?
Tom eats the same food every day.
She sat beside me in church.
Can you jump over a chair from a standing position?
Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him where I'd gone.
The following was inspired in part by a true story.
I've done that several times.
Can I have some of these?
He bought me a nice camera.
I didn't realize you could speak French.
I will explain it to her.
You watch too much TV.
Hand it to me.
How did you get those?
Don't be a chicken.
No one will survive.
You're loaded.
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you.
How much money do you need?
Did you sew this by hand?
I don't need anyone's help.
Who would you like to speak to?
He worked all day yesterday.
Run!
Small family farms were disappearing.
I guess I was mistaken.
Karima hasn't read the letter yet.
She is making dinner.
I'm thankful for vacations.
This bike belongs to my little brother.
Everybody desires happiness.
I didn't go to school last month.
I'm about the same age as you.
Tom is making a lot of money.
That will please my father.
Will you go?
I don't know whether he will agree to our plan or not.
It's all behind you now.
She came to like the house.
I wrote three letters yesterday.
I don't feel like doing my math homework now.
Is it really that hard to speak French?
I'm not on duty.
I don't like this idea.
I must decide what to do.
Be alert when you cross a busy street!
You've been selected.
We need to get some medical supplies.
I was just trying to help.
I wish I could give up smoking.
She celebrated her fifteenth birthday yesterday.
I'd like something to drink.
The pleasure is mine.
You've ruined your clothes.
This isn't enough.
We can't just cut people's salaries without giving them some warning.
I know people.
Do you know the reason?
No way!
She lives just down the street.
He went in place of me.
You missed the target.
Look at all these flowers.
Are we alone in the universe?
I was just messing around.
There must be a solution.
This job pays pretty well.
You can't smoke here.
He stood there for a while.
I usually have dessert after dinner.
Tom's glad.
I'm going to use it tomorrow.
You're not the only one with this problem.
Freedom isn't free.
Tom has lots of money.
This is the house where he was brought up.
That was pretty awesome.
She's always on the go.
We can win.
Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?
I trust her.
I have to borrow some money.
I enjoyed it very much.
Tom is deranged.
They abandoned the hill to enemy forces.
We're all very worried about you.
You forgot to mention that.
Where did you go to school?
These are my students.
He reached home shortly before five o'clock.
You have to live with it.
Do you think you could do that again?
Spring is the best season to visit Kyoto.
Tom didn't expect to sell his old car for so much money.
Tom was a blackmailer.
I want to know what you mean.
We'll come to look for you.
I want it to be a success.
There has to be a first time for everything.
Do you like it when I do this?
We have something else in common.
What time are we leaving?
Do you have plans for dinner?
Don't expect overtime.
What are you crunching on?
When did you buy this building?
Few people live to be ninety years old.
She was not interested in boys at all.
They ganged up on him.
That's not how I see it.
The wreckage is scattered over a large area.
Where did you go to college?
What narrow stairs!
The Greens are against everything.
It's not stupid.
I can see you're in a good mood.
It's better you don't know.
He showed us a few pictures.
He was always trying to provoke an argument.
I'm in danger.
I don't remember your name.
A man began to follow Tom.
Will you do me a favor?
It was very cold.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
She started kissing him as soon as he got home.
I can hardly hear him.
I don't know what's got into her.
We should've paid attention.
Tom is a very good farmer.
We can't just sit here without doing anything.
I got dressed in a hurry.
They entered into a discussion.
Some people gain weight when they stop smoking.
I want to get out of here.
He was sitting on the floor.
I didn't understand what was happening.
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
Why don't you start at the beginning?
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
I never laid a finger on her.
Ten years have passed since he died.
Tom has beautiful blue eyes.
You can use a dictionary for this exam.
I'd be much obliged if you could give me a lift into town.
What do you do in your free time?
I didn't think I needed any help.
You're old.
It is wrong to steal money.
I've got really good news.
They had a duty.
I'm already ready.
Mary told Tom that she was moving to Boston.
I don't mind helping you clean up after the party.
No kidding?
That's all I was waiting for.
I must hand in the report today.
Is anyone on board?
A lot of guys around here hate you.
Could somebody give us a hand?
She treated him very well.
Do you remember who I am?
You are very brave.
I inherited his estate.
I canceled my hotel reservation.
I'll put you through to the president.
Please write your date of birth here.
He's writing a long letter.
I have to go to my office.
May I use the phone?
Is anyone else excited?
I must speak with you alone.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.
How are your parents doing?
Do you ever sleep?
They were too tired to fight.
Do you mean you're giving up?
I don't know what I was thinking.
This was not supposed to happen.
I'm ashamed to ask you such a silly question.
What did you just say?
It's a matter of vital importance.
I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist.
It's excruciatingly slow.
Does this hurt?
Why not let Tom try?
I remember what you said the other day.
I like neither apples nor grapes.
I want us to do it together.
I felt somebody pat me on the shoulder.
She laughed so hard she cried.
I drive a hybrid.
He gambled on the war coming to an early end.
Do you mind if I come in?
Are you tired of living?
Germany made an alliance with Italy.
Mary isn't my girlfriend. She's just a friend.
The stock price index soared to an all-time high.
It was all worth it.
I've missed so many opportunities.
We'll have loads of fun.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
We're tired of waiting.
There's no smoke without fire.
Tom hates it when Mary does that.
You should probably speak a little bit slower.
We have to make do with what we've got.
I don't share your optimism.
I'm playing the piano now.
I'm beginning to get the idea.
Employers sometimes exploit their workers.
I just feel a little dizzy.
You won't drown if you learn how to swim.
I don't have time to help now.
I was relieved to hear that he was safe.
I can't tell what it is.
Did she ever confide in you about the problems she was having?
This is a very small book.
Tom will spend the rest of his life in prison.
You seem depressed.
I'm untalented.
I have won.
Is the sun up yet?
Tom seems to be very surprised.
They prefer the shadows rather than the spotlight.
They handled it well.
I really liked what you cooked for me.
I bought a watch.
I like Tom.
Don't look so shocked.
Our college uses far too much electricity.
I burst out laughing.
They look similar in some ways.
I'll send you a picture.
Do you feel lucky?
I don't want to go to school.
We have little time to waste.
The thick fog prevented the plane from taking off.
What a dump.
What are the dimensions of the room?
I have some good news for you.
You're very tall.
Why don't you let me take a look?
Do you think anyone can see me?
Tom has no choice but to stay.
He will make a good team captain.
I know what you went through.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
I can't figure out anything.
I like this one even better.
I plan to move to Boston.
She is busy learning English.
She visited her husband in prison.
He is American.
I have poor eyesight.
How many more forks do you need?
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I feel so bad.
I need a lamp.
Tom took Monday off.
You may choose whichever book you like.
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Tom sold his car without hesitation.
It happened in a flash.
Let me put this in perspective for you.
You shouldn't depend too much on other people to help you.
I'm working on it.
Camels have three eyelids.
He delivered a speech.
Turn your papers in.
To know oneself is not easy.
I can survive alone.
Tom recently dyed his hair red.
There are five in our family.
Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause hallucinations.
I am used to staying up late at night.
We must not forget our promise.
The dog was dying.
There's something Tom isn't telling Mary.
Why did Tom tell Mary that?
What were you doing about this time yesterday?
Be nicer to your sister.
Give me a little time to think.
I came with my friends.
What are you going to do to me?
She had a real talent for smoothing over troubled situations.
Why are your blinds closed?
We need time.
We all have our orders.
I met an old friend by chance.
Was that a squirrel?
May I help you?
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Is the coffee hot?
Who forced you to do that?
Maybe Tom knows something.
You better get some sleep.
The enemy is weak.
I need to be left alone.
How are you holding up?
This author is critical of the mainstream media.
Desperate men often do desperate things.
I had to see you.
The cat lay hidden in the bushes.
You've lost your marbles.
Are you still angry at me?
Did you refresh the page?
I can't show you.
She'll love him forever.
When was the last time you took the subway?
I agree.
I saw you out here by yourself and thought you might like someone to talk to.
You cannot separate the milk from the coffee once you put it in.
I don't have a spare shirt.
Somebody has stolen my suitcase.
I have a student visa.
Don't ask any questions.
What kind of man was he?
Everybody in that family has a car of their own.
He goes to school on foot.
He has been to England twice.
I think you should leave now.
I'm one of your students.
Was it interesting?
Haiti is a nation that seems hopelessly impoverished.
The walls were covered with graffiti.
Don't talk about yourself like that.
Let me call my lawyer.
Who said I stole the money?
I don't have a lot of time. Can you take care of it?
I've heard that it is best to always feed your dog at a specific time every day.
I think you should do this on your own.
You might get something in the mail today.
Tom isn't safe.
I'd be careful.
I got tired of lying in bed all day.
I don't usually read this kind of book.
She likes to read books.
Will you take me there?
He was elected captain of the team.
I get up early in the morning.
Have you written in your diary today?
She is very shy and feels ill at ease at parties.
I had to get some help.
I'll teach you many things.
Monday will be a rainy day.
Pack your gear.
I'd like to get some sleep.
Are you so stupid that you can't see it?
Did you have a good day?
Are you seriously thinking about quitting your job?
My father's hobby is fishing.
The conference went according to plan.
I grew up in Australia.
It doesn't work yet.
Tom still hasn't paid me.
I can't decide which bicycle to buy.
She allowed me to go.
I paid him on the spot for his work.
A reception was given for the Japanese foreign minister.
Turn the knob and open the door.
I think you should do this on your own.
The floor has just been waxed.
I don't think Tom is old enough to drive.
We closed the restaurant.
It looks like you were wrong.
Do you ever think about that girl?
The brown horse is fast.
That's a tough question to answer.
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama.
I can't take it anymore.
Why are you all dressed up?
He bought a dozen eggs.
We're lucky Tom is here to help us do this.
I want to make my father proud.
You can do whatever you want now.
Can I bum a cigarette off you?
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
I've never sung this before.
I don't believe a word you say.
I'll answer all your questions.
I just want to say I love you.
They have no more wine.
Just tell me what to do.
You made this all possible.
How much money did you spend in total?
I'm thinking of going to Germany to study medicine.
What a splendid idea!
He used every chance to practice English.
I'm available.
Why don't you have a drink?
I folded the towels.
It's easier this way.
It was all a big lie.
What did you want to see me about?
You reap what you sow.
I think Tom believed me.
How did you get them?
Who did you bring the flowers to?
Would you like a cup of tea?
Whereabouts did you say this happened?
My watch is different from yours.
I did a little research.
He was hospitalized for a surgical operation.
My friend told me that he had bought a new watch.
I'll always remember you.
I met him by pure chance.
They went crazy.
They said they're thirsty.
What'll it cost?
Why would you want me to stay?
Fish and red wine don't go together.
Tom isn't concerned about that.
We did everything we could.
He died recently.
What are you waiting for?
He often quotes Milton.
I'm looking forward to meeting your parents.
I can't wait until tomorrow.
She is two years older than you.
Did anybody see what happened?
I'm glad you came over.
Tom will never know.
How much money did you spend on your last holiday?
I work alone.
This is how I met your mother.
Both Tom and Mary work as models.
The man blushed like a boy.
Stop worrying about it.
I will gladly help you.
Will you ever tell me your age?
This one is all yours.
It was very windy.
Do you have any questions about what needs to be done?
I thought we had agreed on this.
He accelerated his car and overtook me.
The sound of a gunshot echoed across the canyon.
I know you think I'm stupid.
Can you supply me with all I need?
You should do that soon.
What time is your plane landing?
Tom certainly didn't expect to win.
What was taken?
Don't make me shoot you.
Tom doesn't know that he's adopted.
I want a cup of coffee and I want it now.
He approached the station.
I smell blood.
She was asked to convince him to paint the house.
You don't have to explain.
Shall I draw a map for you?
What other reason could there be?
Run for it!
That's exactly what he wanted.
He risked his life to save her.
That's what I'm asking you to do.
I can draw you a picture of that if you want me to.
I figured you'd be here.
I'm really fed up with this heat.
Not every community was affected.
What would you suggest that I do?
I just found out that my boyfriend has been stepping out on me.
Let's hope this never happens again.
It could happen to anyone.
How many of us were there?
Where can I take a bath?
I own this place.
I owe you a sincere apology.
You will never be too old to learn.
Everyone deserves a second chance.
How many sisters do you have?
The motor does not function properly.
Tom nodded.
I'm glad I have a friend like you to confide in.
They stayed at a luxury hotel.
I've never seen you like this.
Have you ever eaten raw fish?
They love this song.
Tom never came out of his coma.
I had to act quickly.
Supplies were no problem.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Do you think this is real?
We bought our plane tickets two months in advance.
Can I use a credit card?
No one was with me.
The work was finished before I arrived.
I'm glad no one got hurt.
I don't like waiting for you.
The mafia boss was killed in a hail of machine gun fire.
It rained for an entire week.
Tom finally decided to try jumping over the stream.
I guess I've gotten lazy.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
She never wears green.
Tom looks dazed.
We've really got to step on it.
I'll play along.
You should eat vegetables.
You don't have to talk so loud.
You must ask for permission.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
I took that picture a week ago.
Paris is one of the largest cities in the world.
Tom is our guest.
I'm not surprised you don't remember.
I'm not evil.
Let go of my arms.
He is said to have been very poor when he was young.
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
Tom will be back in a second.
You're not dead.
She asked me about my mother.
This article is for sale.
I'm not home.
I love myself.
Time's up.
I've never told anyone that my father is in prison.
I really don't feel good.
Did you know this was coming down?
I had no idea what to expect.
I was absent from school because I had a cold.
It's almost over.
Tom shook my hand.
You may go anywhere you like.
How old were you when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?
I want my share of the money.
He's in the kitchen.
This beef is very nice and tender.
You should do that right now.
I can't remember her address.
Tom kept his hat on.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
Have a cookie.
I'm not familiar with French poets.
He's a creationist.
Am I interrupting something?
I just want to help.
I heard the bell.
We've got to call the police.
He removed his shirt.
He's not paying any attention to me.
This bike belongs to my little brother.
She knit him a sweater.
Tom said that Mary wasn't in a hurry.
They are jealous of our success.
I apologize to all of you.
We haven't decided yet.
This is the last place I want to be right now.
I've done things I'm not proud of.
He was not happy about it.
I'm afraid I've offended you.
Have you heard that a burglar broke into my neighbor's house?
Don't exert yourself.
I can't stand fishing.
Lies beget more lies.
Which one of you wasn't on the bus?
My father doesn't drink so much sake.
I think this piano hasn't been tuned for a few years.
Do you have any messages for me?
She forced him to do it.
War concerns us all.
He's a very nice boy.
Can I use your telephone?
I feel really bad.
You sound like a broken record.
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
Tom needs me.
The bus drivers are on strike today.
This just doesn't make sense.
Tom has messed up everything.
Tom asked us to turn down the music.
Everybody's happy.
Do you have a ticket?
There is no third choice.
We're not going ashore.
I know you want to go home.
Haven't you learned your lesson?
None of the teachers could solve the problem.
He is always reading.
He lit the candles.
It's a small world.
Tom isn't trained.
We still have a few left.
That's not what happened here.
You can't handle it.
You're out of order.
You must start at once.
I really do hope we can still be friends.
He prepared for his imminent departure.
You look like you're busy.
How interesting!
I overslept because my alarm didn't go off.
The sky is getting brighter.
You people are amazing.
She told him to study.
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
They all envied my new car.
I couldn't stand anymore.
What floor do you live on?
Could you take our picture?
He went traveling in search of adventure.
She was advised by him to listen to her doctor.
You can trust him. He'll never betray you.
My mother set the table for dinner.
I like to read books.
Tom took a lot of pictures.
Don't you think this suits me?
I'm not sure that that's a good idea.
My father quickly scanned the newspaper.
Individual freedom is the foundation of democracy.
I bought a red diary.
That's what scared me.
A haiku is one type of poem.
I have had it.
Let's get out of the taxi.
Would you like to go see a movie with me?
Do you like to study?
Don't let the cat out of the bag.
Tom ran outside half-naked.
He turned out to be innocent.
It won't be easy.
You'd like Tom.
I have nothing to fear.
Could you send up some stomach medicine?
How much money do I owe you?
We can't reveal classified information.
That magazine is aimed at teenagers.
Tom couldn't help but cry.
Tom's birthday was the day before yesterday.
Tom has a son named John.
I suddenly feel depressed.
You're courteous.
I'll read the book.
I didn't order this.
Tell me what your address is.
It's not too late to tell Tom that you love him.
Tom has lived in Boston for more than a year.
She met him for breakfast.
Tom can drive a car.
Can someone open a window?
It's not hopeless.
He is afraid that he will die.
This is disgusting.
I'm not so sure I want to study French.
Tom is waiting at the bus stop.
They have lost a lot.
Tom has to stay in Boston this weekend.
I'll keep your secret.
My sister is afraid of all doctors.
We go to Boston as often as we can.
What's the teacher explaining?
Don't speak ill of others.
I just heard another explosion.
Tom has a desktop computer.
Let me think a minute.
What did you try to do?
Be polite to your parents.
I only have one thing left to do.
Go outside.
There is no dress code.
I almost never watch TV.
He's a world-class scientist.
You said you wanted to ask me something.
I can tell you're angry.
I've never been so proud.
My grandmother is always complaining of the cold.
I found the broken camera.
Illness prevented me from going to the party.
I'm realistic.
My sister is not a high school student.
The car turned to the left.
I thought you'd gone home.
I thought you wouldn't give up.
They were members of the middle class.
No one knows where Tom's gone.
That's just what I wanted to hear.
She made a lot of spelling mistakes.
You two are really kind.
Are there enough chairs for everyone?
Tom asked Mary for assistance.
What do you think of Japan?
Can I think about it?
I ran for mayor.
I'm glad to have this opportunity to work with you.
Back off.
Don't slam the door.
Don't stand up.
No one is too old to learn.
Tom is always working.
They agreed to work together.
They're all alike.
I want to know who sent you.
Anyone hurt?
Tom was lucky that he didn't get killed.
Don't let that dog come near me!
I drive everywhere.
Are they taking care of you?
It looks like you did a pretty good job.
Did she show you the picture?
I just want to watch this.
I figured I might find you here.
I'm much older than you are.
I killed two birds with one stone.
I love the taste of watermelon.
It is a pity you cannot come.
I guess that I'm just tired.
Tom is waiting for you in his office.
That's your department.
Tom doesn't speak French at home.
Tom is three years older than I am.
Did you make any new friends?
He was very poor.
I won't let you die.
I'm delighted to hear that.
She was looking forward to going to a movie with him.
They have wine.
A good sense of humor will help you deal with hard times.
It's all wrong.
It's worse than I thought.
The boy has good reflexes.
Don't just stand there.
They hate each other from the bottoms of their hearts.
He always talks as though he were addressing a public meeting.
The mayor provided me with an identity card.
It did the trick.
Does she still have a temperature?
They're mad at you.
He lives frugally.
What are you cooking?
Turn to the right.
He kept us waiting for more than an hour.
Write on every other line.
They're just students.
Why don't we talk about something else?
I don't go to school anymore.
His child behaves well.
They have no natural predators.
The company's failed.
I have a bit of time to relax.
I want to spend some time with my daughter.
I sat on the sofa.
Tom was here just a moment ago.
That's not my opinion.
Let's get cracking!
I said I would help you.
I'm losing weight.
Classes start at eight in the morning.
We're going to do everything we can.
That kind of thing doesn't happen in this neighborhood.
Where are the showers?
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
Very little is known about them.
He sat next to her.
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
This sentence hasn't yet been translated.
I told Tom Mary was telling the truth.
I don't think I said that.
I don't want people to hate me.
I look forward to seeing you at Christmas.
I tried to save you.
They jumped through a window into the river.
We probably don't want to do that again.
You must perform your duty.
She wept the entire night.
Have a drink while you're waiting.
He played the part of Hamlet.
What was the hotel called? I can't remember.
I'm happy you two are friends again.
I am very hungry.
I listen to the radio every night.
Is there anything you can do?
This must be for you.
I don't know what to say.
She doesn't like soccer.
I moaned.
We close at 7 p.m.
She is familiar with the subject.
I think perhaps you're right.
Try to avoid bad company.
I think we're on the right path.
The dog growled at me.
Is there anything you'd like to share?
Tell me where he is.
Do what I say.
Eating fish is good for your health.
I don't want to know what you did yesterday.
He's here for me.
There's been a change of plans.
This beef is tender.
You're rich.
How much do those things cost?
Did you just hit Tom?
No one understands that.
It's taboo.
Did you go to the restaurant yesterday?
There's a big hole.
They abandoned their country.
What do you need me to do?
Do you think you could make a little less noise?
Do you want to go out tonight?
I know you want to help.
What are you supposed to do?
Don't worry about the cost.
I'll go whenever you like.
You woke me.
He lived to be ninety.
I wish I could buy that guitar.
Who are you going with?
We are in a difficult situation.
Are they actually friends?
Some of the students like to play the guitar.
The thermostat is defective.
Would you like to go to the lake with us?
When does school let out for the holidays?
I'm asking you for your help.
This car comes with an air conditioner.
I never thought about it before.
Why don't you stop?
I don't care what you do with your money.
Don't touch my car.
I haven't told the kids yet that we're getting divorced.
Don't try to do two things at a time.
The windows were already open when I got here.
I know him better than anybody.
She made him a cake for his party.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
I've explained all of this to you before.
I ran out of ink.
Read between the lines.
I don't find it a problem.
Are you willing to make a deal?
Let me do the cooking.
You know I'm older than you are.
Thank you for closing the door.
We all became soldiers.
Are you sure you don't want something a little smaller?
I'm delighted to be here.

You cheated.
He was outraged.
Did you think you were right?
He lied to my face.
Tom didn't seem very busy.
You don't have the right.

You must get rid of that bad habit.
I want to go.
They're very close friends.
My father doesn't eat fruit that much.

We had no alternative but to fight.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
He shut the door behind him.
Are you ready to party?
He will advise you on that matter.
It's time.
Have you ever seen a tiger around here?
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
I can't pay all my bills this month.
We were concerned.
Tom goes jogging almost every afternoon.
I had trouble pronouncing his name.
Are you sure it's impossible?
Would that make you happy?
Our whole case hinges on whether the government's actions were constitutional or not.
The architecture in this part of the city is ugly.
We're well on our way to making that happen.
Tom told me he was retired.
She was overcome with happiness.
I don't know whether it is true or not.
I think Tom is hiding from Mary.
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.
I think you might be overreacting.
You're missing the point.
She watched him swim.
Come at any time you like.
What's the weather like today?
I already feel better.
I came to the conclusion that something was wrong.

The fire alarm rang.
He could show his feeling with music instead of words.
I took sides with them in the argument.
She likes the teacher.
It's a complicated matter.

He wanted to meet me.
Give me something I can cut this with.
Let's ask the teacher.
Tom opened the left-hand drawer.
You're a very gifted artist.
The committee consists of four members.
The pleasure is mine.
The roof leaks.
Who will you give the book to?
We danced to the music for hours until we were all exhausted.
Your approval is not required.
I'm sorry to bother you so often.
You didn't have any choice.
It's hard to throw things out.
You have such a beautiful name.
Who wants to come with me?
Am I disturbing you?
There is a lot of crime in big cities.
It'll help you save energy.
None of this makes any sense to me.
This sounds very interesting.
Tom tasted the wine.
He read the poem in a monotone.
Don't make fun of me.
We talked about many things.
The most beloved people in the world are the spontaneous.
Tom saw a large rat run across the street.
Can you ride a horse?
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
How certain are you that he's a criminal?
I only want to help.
Do you have any plans for today?
I have some reading to do.
Why can't I hear?
Tom is taller than Mary.
I didn't know what to say to him.
I must concentrate.
Why haven't we begun?
Tom and Mary have a horse.
Don't make any loud noises.
This coffee tastes great.
I survived.
Where did you get on this bus?
Please don't be angry at me.
Many people are upset.
I want another chance.
The prevention of forest fires is everyone's responsibility.
I feel a bit nauseous.
Isn't that unusual?
This is the final straw.
You reason like a three-year-old.
What do you hope to find here?
You should have breakfast every day.
Mary is on maternity leave.
She is certain to be surprised.
I know how to read between the lines.
They always played tennis here.
It can be difficult.
Do you see that?
The baby cried all night.
English is not my first language.
He also speaks French.
Don't I get a goodbye kiss?
Start running.
Are you sure you're not tired?
I am glad that you have returned safe.
We're not ready to do that.
Tom had one of his legs amputated.
It's fun to learn a foreign language.
Do you think that was fair?
I'm going to take care of that customer.
She had white shoes on.
He decided to have surgery.
Wash your face before you go to school.
Do you want to take that?
Would you please explain the rules to me?
I really want you to quit.
I've never been here before.
He lived there by himself.
I don't know what's happened.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
Turn it off.
It wasn't enough.
Who will compensate for the loss?
I came across your brother on the street.
We saw them leave.
I've never felt like this before.
Please show me another camera.
Could you buy everything you needed?
You don't stand a chance.
I want exactly what you want.
I was there a year ago.
I'm going to be gone soon.
Nothing can stop me.
They were worried about getting caught.
The meaning of this letter is unclear.
I can do this with you or without you.
The police arrested the man who had murdered the girl.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
I don't like this weather.
Can you meet me in the auditorium?
Photography is an expensive hobby.
They haven't arrived yet.
I think I caught your cold.
How's your sister today?
It will probably snow tomorrow.
Keep these rules in mind.
I don't know when I can get away.
I just got up.
I don't know what that's all about.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
I don't have time to do what I want to do.
He did it in front of the staff.
Are you a paleontologist?
What are you drinking?
Don't interrupt.
I'm very tired.
Who needs a drink?
She is doing her homework now.
Every girl knows that singer.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
Enjoy your meal.
He doesn't know how to write a letter in English.
What color is this?
They made the right choice.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
The lights went out.
I want to go home now.
Tom knew that Mary was studying French.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
We've met a few times before.
Apples grow on trees.
I'm interested in your work.
Can I see this?
What did you think of him?
I'm not good at eating Japanese food with chopsticks.
You're very open.
I don't want this news to be made public yet.
Tom never would've done this.
I planted a peach tree in my yard.
What did you think of the wedding?
I don't care for coffee.
I don't want to talk.
What shall we buy him for his birthday?
I told you I'm the best.
I'd better get back to work now.
Don't worry.
I am no more an artist than you are.
It won't cost you a dime.
Might I ask your address?
Tom has to pay another three hundred dollars.
My assistant threatened to quit.
I can't tell you their names.
Tom is a history teacher.
Cats are smarter than you think.
I can't go with you.
Don't they drive you mad?
He plays very well.
She believed him when he said he loved her.
I want to talk to you about this list.
She betrayed you.
He will get back soon.
That's no good.
I cleared the table.
I wasn't too sure about it.
Just do it.
Is there any milk left?
The teacher treated all the students fairly.
I thought you were broke.
We will present our idea to the committee.
You did something incredibly stupid.
How can you be so cruel?
I wanted to run away with Tom.
Everyone is trying his best.
I agree completely with you on this point.
Somebody must break the sad news to her mother.
This is a difficult situation.
You'll bounce back.
I don't go to church.
You look good in black.
Don't be ashamed of who you are.
Go look for it.
This one is special.
I'm glad you were able to meet Tom.
It's your bedtime.
I don't understand why you want it.
It has a flaw.
Please do not try this at home.
I'm not really in the mood.
Watch out for that man.
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
Dinosaurs became extinct a very long time ago.
Dinosaurs died out a very long time ago.
You did the right thing.
Can we fix this?
I thought you were serious.
French is a difficult language.
He asked me if I had slept well the night before.
It's up to you.
I don't believe you.
I'm hungry. I want to eat something.
I've got to see you.
She left the old newspapers lying in a heap.
There is no limit to the universe.
I'm not done with you.
We're sure we can do that.
You're embarrassing me.
I love talking to you.
I didn't like the result.
I will wait for you at the bus stop.
The tires are very sticky.
You were great.
Tom got back into the car.
Who invented this machine?
I'm doing everything I can.
I have a message I want you to deliver.
I want to live here.
Tom was escorted out of the building.
We're not being sued.
It seemed appropriate.
Why are we here?
Have you met anyone yet?
There's not enough light in this room for sewing.
The ticket is valid to April 29.
This will protect your skin.
We picked apples so we could make an apple pie.
Did you go to see a doctor?
Give me some time to think.
I wanted to rent a bus.
I'm aware of the danger.
My uncle calls on me every three days.
I leaned forward so I could catch every word he said.
Got it?
You'd like Tom.
Everything's OK now.
I'm by your side.
I asked Tom to wait a minute.
Are you happy with your weight?
Keep away from the fire.
Come to us.
He was punished for drunken driving.
That war ended in 1954.
You're my best customer.
Tom has nowhere left to go.
I really appreciate your coming.
His birthday is May 5th.
You can see that the architect paid scrupulous attention to detail.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
Tom said he hoped he'd be able to help us.
I was very tired today.
My wife works part time.
None of them wanted to talk.
She dreaded having to tell him what had happened.
You must do it.
Find me a glass.
She plays the violin very well.
I want to live in a small town.
The wound is not yet healed.
Just promise me that you won't do anything silly.
I think that might be wise.
I won't tolerate any mistakes.
My brother makes it a rule to look over the newspaper before going to his office.
Where's Mary's ring?
I bought a new hard drive.
She believes her son is still alive.
They were afraid of you.
Tom forgot his trumpet at school.
Ignore them.
The prices go up after six o'clock.
It was seven thirty.
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.
That isn't really necessary.
I'm ready to do that for you.
Why don't you start by telling us what you saw?
My parents are asleep.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
I must get a new suit made.
I'd buy a house if I had the money.
It's up to you and me.
You needn't have taken a taxi.
Tom said he'd call at 2:30.
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
A new model isn't necessarily any better than the older one.
I wash my car once a week.
Don't open your book.
I don't want to kill anyone.
Would you like some more salad?
I got lost in the woods.
I thought it would be an opportunity for you to improve your French.
He arrived shortly after.
Our team lost the first game.
Have you ever heard such a story?
Paper is made from wood.
I'm going to study.
Will you be at home tonight?
This bird can't fly.
She asked him to not quit his job.
I just don't want you to get upset.
Don't let this information leak out.
I met a friend.
Get out of the water.
Let's play chess another time.
How much did the tickets cost you?
I'm a dentist.
Wait!
I would like a word with you.
Where's the ball?
I like this song.
How could anybody not like this?
I know that Tom was shaken.
Do you know what time that supermarket closes?
I hadn't thought of that.
There is a pond in the middle of the park.
I've already apologized for that.
Have you been told when you are expected to be here?
I've lost all respect for you.
Tell me what you think's inside this box.
They laughed at my idea.
Why did you buy only one banana?
What'll you do tomorrow night?
She is qualified as a nurse.
What on earth does this have to do with me?
I'm trying to find a lawyer to handle my case.
You've been infected.
The fireman could not extinguish the flames.
We aren't afraid of death.
We need to do this right.
Go grab a drink.
We're out of luck again.
This book is too large to go in my pocket.
I'm used to the pain now.
You need to stop.
You should eat more fruit.
This is my notebook.
My bicycle needs to be repaired.
He gathered the courage to decline the offer.
They walked down the street singing a song.
We are sorry to say that we can not give you that information.
Why don't you eat vegetables?
I will have finished the work before you return.
Tom didn't want to go to the doctor.
They shouldn't be doing that.
You'll have to learn to cook.
Tom had no right to treat Mary like he did.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
Tom wanted to play chess.
Why don't you take your coat off?
I admire your work ethic.
He is always forgetting things.
Can I see you at ten tomorrow?
Was there enough money?
I hate to wait.
We couldn't help but think that he was dead.
He keeps his word.
He will have to undergo an operation next week.
You can get a lot of bang for your buck at this store.
I'm not the one who crashed the car.
What's the easiest way to learn French?
You did that.
I need to be alone.
Shut that door.
Tom has been late every day this week.
What's your dad's name?
Tom's famous.
Who are you talking with?
She passed away two days ago.
Does this skirt suit me?
I don't expect you to forgive me.
This is the perfect place.
There was a traffic accident in front of the house yesterday.
The rent is cheap.
Tom has decided to leave the company.
What are you implying?
The garrison was forced to surrender.
She asked him how to get to the station.
Shake hands with him.
A little warning would've been nice.
We're the problem.
No one saw me.
I really appreciate your offer to help me clean out my garage.
He keeps on asking me for money.
I see no reason to tell you anything.
We've been wasting a lot of time.
Did you see the news?
I broke up with my girlfriend.
You made the same mistake.
Have you decided what you're going to do?
You have a lot of time.
It would be a good idea if I went.
Go with the flow.
I know I can trust you.
Young people are usually full of energy.
He's offered to help.
Why didn't you listen to me?
I'm trying to quit smoking.
I never go anywhere.
He must be a good walker to have walked such a long distance.
Don't make me regret this.
You have the necessary skills.
I feel bad for them.
That happens to me all the time.
Tell us about your new book.
We were very busy last week.
I was disappointed by your article.
You're my guests.
Tom couldn't help but be impressed.
I wish you had come with us.
He seems to be a nice fellow.
Do you love music?
We don't want any freeloaders around here.
Who are you supposed to be?
She cooks for him.
The children were asleep upstairs.
Who forced you to do that?
He stared at her hand for a moment.
You must be careful with the wine glass.
Don't come near me.
The problem is being discussed now.
I'm done listening to you.
I'd like to borrow fifty dollars from you.
The dog bit my hand.
It's one of those.
You're such a liar.
She is guilty of theft.
Both of them are very cute.
Put the thermometer under your arm.
We run together.
Is the customer always right?
I worked really hard on this.
Did you think I would leave you here?
Haven't you learned your lesson?
The weather is threatening.
I thought that we could stay here all day.
Does this skirt suit me?
It's hard for him to live on his small pension.
How much is this umbrella?
Please let me try the game.
Tom was wearing his pajamas when he opened the door.
I immediately said no.
Have you ever walked through a graveyard at midnight?
The average American living space is twice as large as the living space in Japan.
This is the boy who found your watch.
You don't need to worry about that kind of thing anymore.
Our guide knows the history of all these places.
We want to reach a wider audience.
He was jealous of their happiness.
I used to believe everything you said.
I find it hard to believe.
I have seen enough.
Be nice.
You need to grow up.
I no longer love you.
I haven't done that very many times yet.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
Let's grab a quick lunch at that small coffeeshop near the park.
I'm doing it in spite of you.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
I cannot lift this stone.
This is not safe.
Please don't enter the room without knocking.
Spiders scare me.
Have you eaten dinner?
Keep the window closed.
She heard him sing.
Tom helps anyone who asks for help.
My computer crashed and now it won't start up.
You were behaving as if nothing had happened.
Take heed of her advice.
I'm living in a small town.
Can you swim?
I'm the one who's been lied to.
Will we arrive on time?
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour.
Maybe he won't become famous.
I didn't mean to insult you.
I want these.
There are many wild animals in this area.
I want something to drink.
I thought you could swim.
The tower leaned slightly to the left.
I want to end this.
I actually think it's a very good idea.
You didn't keep your word.
They walked upstairs.
Here is the map.
My joints ache when it gets cold.
He is no longer in business.
He is much better than me at the high jump.
Who are your working for?
I like your attitude.
I bought it in a thrift store.
You don't have to answer.
Isn't he a bit young?
Tom reminds me of a boy I used to know.
Tom helped Mary with her luggage.
She turned the doorknob slowly.
You're no fun.
That work was done very quickly.
You were right and I was wrong.
The boy didn't change his opinion.
We were both thirsty.
Few people can speak a foreign language perfectly.
Tom is on his phone.
Do you see that house? That's my house.
I had to choose between A and B.
It'll rain for sure.
I can feel my pulse quickening already.
He is constantly complaining.
Did you sleep much last night?
We'll get in touch with you as soon as possible.
She was formerly a bank clerk.
I can't let that happen again.
Stay right where you are.
Did you sleep all day?
I don't have enough.
The company went bankrupt.
I've given this a lot of thought.
Christmas is coming.
Tom and Mary have never been to that restaurant.
Tom didn't take off his shirt.
They had to read the book many times.
I made a few modifications.
A huge federal budget deficit has been plaguing the American economy for many years.
I don't think I could live without you.
Do you think this jelly's firm enough to eat yet?
It looks like an egg.
He asked a favor of me.
How much is your hourly pay?
Tom steals stuff.
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him.
Your efforts will soon pay off.
I know you must be afraid.
Our TV is out of order.
Don't forget to mail the letter.
I don't know how to pronounce his name.
We heard the door shut.
You missed a lot.
I've done my job.
I wasn't on the right bus.
Should we go?
Are they tall?
I'll be back on Monday.
We can't get along without Tom.
Who is that man?
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
Let me ask you a question.
I think you are the one who broke it.
They all laughed at his error.
This flower is more beautiful than that one.
Tom and Mary often eat dinner together.
You must be careful.
You shouldn't eat just before you go to bed.
We're quite alone.
Let's proceed.
I think that he's a good teacher.
I've never tried doing this before.
My grandmother became sick last week.
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.
They are pilots.
Please send me a letter as soon as you arrive.
Can I change the subject?
That would be very sad.
I'm joking.
They knew how much danger they'd be in.
The door could not be opened.
The way you sit tells a great deal about your nature.
I don't think I can make it to your party.
Do you go to church on Christmas Day?
I wanted to show you this.
Don't interrupt me.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
You were perfect.
Can you skip me?
You won't believe who came by today.
They sank ten enemy ships.
I'm near the station.
Friends help each other. Just let me know what's wrong.
You should do that now.
Tom was obviously worried about what might happen.
Stay out of my way!
Get out of my room.
Tom wanted me to walk home with him.
It's worse than I thought.
He sent money to help care for her.
I'm in Boston all this week.
Your cat is fat.
I can't force you to do anything.
Is the bridge safe?
My father has been dead for ten years.
I can't trust anybody.
What do you learn at school?
I'd be very grateful if you'd help me.
You can never tell how long these meetings will last.
This is cheap.
Nice weather added to our pleasure.
I will call you in an hour.
You're not helping.
The young man put out his hand and I shook it.
Which eye is hurting you?
I'll get lost.
I am very interested in music.
We had fun with them.
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
Tom was in trouble financially.
We won't have enough time to do that before Tom gets here.
Tell me how I can help you.
Watch your tongue.
How can you say that?
I buy tapes.
I'm beginning to smell a rat.
I think we're all a bit cuckoo.
I can't do it justice.
She always tries something new.
My hip hurts.
We estimate the damage at one thousand dollars.
I could barely contain my excitement.
Tom cried all morning.
I read the report you wrote.
Let's head for that tall tree.
This is no time for modesty.
I'm relieved to hear that.
Stay inside.
They say he is very rich.
When did he get back?
She went to the station to see him off.
We're still in good shape.
What a cute baby!
The corpse has a gunshot wound in the chest.
She woke up.
We walked in the park.
How was the universe formed?
That is out of the question.
That's when I went to the police.
I have a bad pain in my lower back.
This letter isn't addressed to you.
Nowadays many people travel by car.
I like you as a friend.
The cow gave birth to a calf with two heads.
I'm sure you're busy.
Tom came yesterday.
I asked him not to play the piano late at night.
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
Do you know that guy?
I was beaten.
Which team will win?
I've got some very good news.
A dreary landscape spread out for miles in all directions.
I really need to go home and catch some zees.
You are selling him short.
I never asked you to do that.
We'll never forget your kindness.
I remember writing to her.
She wanted to live a more relaxing life.
Is there anything else you want me to do?
They apologized for the inconvenience.
He advised caution.
But I was careful.
I was kept waiting nearly half an hour.
He should have bought some pencils.
Tom and Mary really loved each other.
He kissed me passionately.
A comparable car would cost far more in Japan.
I wish you could have come with me.
What are the five senses?
Little lights were blinking on and off in the distance.
I'm the one who ought to apologize.
Are you imitating me?
I know that you were right.
Can you elaborate?
She is as beautiful as her mother.
Tom leads a quiet life.
You have done very well.
This bed is not comfortable.
He has long legs.
Your hair is too long.
I need to know what you know.
This could be serious.
Do we have to speak French?
I don't have a contract yet.
We lived close by the sea.
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed.
It makes me feel dirty.
Changes came quickly.
Everybody's home.
Send for the doctor at once.
I need you in my life.
Is your car comfortable?
This is everything I've ever wanted.
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
Come along with me.
I never meant to put you in any danger.
I plan to go to France next year.
She invited him in.
You are my friend.
Tom jumped out of the window.
How did you come by this painting?
We're out of ammunition.
This lake is very deep.
Can you prove it?
We're both on the same side.
I respect you.
She's a professional photographer.
It's a classic.
Open your mouth!
Tom has been given a new job.
How many days do you plan to stay?
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to live.
I just got a promotion.
Why don't you stay there?
Where can one buy books?
We were all tired.
I want you to treat me a little nicer from now on.
I like trains very much.
One of the windows was broken.
Where does Tom study?
Gasoline costs more in France than in the United States.
They'll eat those.
It gives me the shivers.
He is afraid of Father.
You should work hard.
I'm secretly in love with someone else's wife.
Keep this to yourself.
Elephants are the largest land animals alive today.
He works Sundays.
I know that you trust Tom.
You're going to be OK.
Tom seems to know the way.
I glanced at my watch.
You need written permission.
Is this your first conference in Paris?
There is a little milk left in the bottle.
Tom has no goals in life.
My doctor told me to give up smoking.
I'm afraid it's going to rain.
Thank you for the information.
We did everything we could.
Do you really think Tom will help us?
Water becomes solid when it freezes.
I'm making tea.
You're conscientious.
Don't give up.
I like my job just fine.
I'd better do something before the problem gets any worse.
I'd like to check your blood pressure.
Tom must be proud of you.
I never really wanted to study French.
Has anyone ever broken your heart?
Is there a mailbox near here?
He sat on the bench.
Tom is leaving Kobe tomorrow morning.
You're disgusting.
They're dying.
Her father is a policeman.
He's drunk.
Do you need me to repeat the question?
Isn't that an amazing coincidence?
I already have an envelope.
I banged my leg on the coffee table.
I reminded him of his interview with the president.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
He was wearing a threadbare suit.
I know the answer.
You can't handle it.
I'll buy you that bracelet.
Where are the paintings?
I'll do anything you wish.
Something's missing.
I really enjoy spending time with you.
These roses are from Tom.
She bowed in thanks.
We felt at home.
Look before you leap.
Stay out of my business.
I am disgusted with him.
My doctor has advised me to stop taking this medicine.
They are melons.
The dog ran after a fox.
Do you mind if I help myself?
Are those yours?
I don't know how you stayed in that job all this time.
Your comments made Tom laugh.
I didn't have time to do everything that needed to be done.
I'll protect Tom.
My school is getting ready for the campus music festival.
Walking from the station to the house takes only five minutes.
He is not old enough to live alone.
Is tomorrow a holiday?
Food costs money.
Would you care for some more cake?
I tried to protect you.
I'll do that tomorrow.
You couldn't have picked a better time.
We managed to get it back without her knowing.
The children are riding their bikes.
I wanted the best.
Stop screaming like a girl.
The people he is living with in London are coming to see me.
That should suffice.
He sold his business and retired.
I don't want Tom to see that.
She says that she likes flowers.
We're unhappy.
Where's everyone?
Tom was my cellmate.
Crime is on the increase.
They're cannibals.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I don't think we need to do it.
Tom accidentally shot himself in the foot while cleaning his gun.
I am already forgetting my grandmother's face.
He said hello to the woman.
Why are we doing all this?
How long would it take to swim across the river?
This novel is boring.
What's all the excitement about?
Tom is a teacher like me.
This car is bigger than that one.
I have to help my mother.
What more could you want?
I love comic books.
Did anyone hear me?
It's a one-time offer.
I didn't think you were so old.
Take a look.
When did you notice that?
He soon accustomed himself to cold weather.
I had to beg my friends to come to my party.
You'd better not stay up too late.
Why are you interested?
Life without love is just totally pointless.
I never like to travel by train.
Let's not overreact.
I'm really not supposed to do this.
Do you mind if I take a day off?
Each of them was given a prize.
I share your feelings.
How was your summer vacation?
Let me call you back.
We'll decide by voting.
Get outside right now.
You'll end up in jail.
I was convinced that he was guilty.
He will come soon.
Walking is a healthy form of exercise.
I can swim very fast.
There wasn't much news in last night's newspaper.
It's a problem we do not have any answer for.
I've already told Tom what to do.
Tom helped.
It was OK.
I hope you're not planning to do that today.
Tom told Mary an interesting story.
I don't know why he said that to me.
I wasn't surprised at all.
Don't be ridiculous.
Don't you believe me?
I'm not blushing!
This is not a good sign.
Have you ever taken a lie detector test?
This movie is rated PG-13.
He's wanted for grand theft auto.
A field of grass can be quite beautiful.
Why did you want to speak with us?
I made him sweep the floor.
Have you gone crazy?
I didn't want you to know.
He used me as a guinea pig.
Do you mind if we sit down?
You're not safe there.
That was our biggest problem.
But we don't have anything in common at all.
Nothing can be worse than that.
If only I had more money.
How bad is the damage?
Cheese and butter are products made from milk.
They were very confused.
They are typical young people.
You lucky devil!
I do a lot of things.
I didn't want to be seen.
He will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
It's pretty incredible.
Do you want to come over tonight?
He doesn't have a computer.
Someone turned the alarm off.
Don't open the door for anyone.
I can't bring myself to do such a thing.
Students have access to the library.
You don't look so busy.
What kind of person would do that kind of thing?
I kept my mouth shut.
He always walks with a rifle.
Stop apologizing.
No drugs were found.
I have to pay more attention to myself.
That's all I have to say.
You should see Tom's picture.
They're nice guys.
My father is proud of the fact that he's never been in a traffic accident.
My headache is gone.
She stayed there for a moment.
Tom isn't going to forget that.
We're married.
Stop me if you can.
He's studying hard so he can pass the entrance exam.
What did you want to show me?
Man is the only animal that can speak.
What was in the envelope?
Mary rested her head on Tom's shoulder.
Would you please shut up?
You can't just leave us here with no food and water.
They are going to give a party the day after tomorrow.
I don't go to the movies as often as I'd like.
This is a superb idea.
He ran into the room.
Do you have any more of those?
A leap year has three hundred and sixty-six days.
How big is your yard?
Promise me that you'll help Tom.
Dad stretched after dinner.
You're my best customer.
Is it genuine?
The politician tried to cover up the insider trading.
I need to hear it.
This is odd.
Can you help me with the washing up?
What's his name?
She shot him.
You may take anything you like.
How does it look?
I have to make sure that Tom and Mary don't do that.
No one wants to go there.
It helps.
What quantity of paper do you need?
I didn't think anyone was home.
Who's the photographer?
Shall I begin?
I didn't know how to express myself.
I know that that wasn't the answer you wanted.
There is a bird feeder in our backyard.
Tom spent thirty days in jail.
He lost everything.
They won the kissing contest.
Trust me on this.
May I see you in private?
Don't take any chances.
The boy told me why he was crying.
I'm jittery.
I know that that would make me happy.
Everyone prayed.
How do you know that you don't need a bodyguard?
I grow many kinds of roses.
Can you buy one for me as well?
What would you do if you had a billion dollars?
Follow my advice.
A crowd gathered at the scene.
I don't know what the meeting will be about.
What a heel!
She has a cat and two dogs.
Tom didn't like the picnic.
The package arrived three hours ago.
We arrived at the office on time.
She is saving her money with a view to taking a trip around the world.
That's another story.
I like long stories with surprise endings.
What's your area of specialization?
Do you know how to unlock this door?
Do you really want to do that today?
I need to talk with you.
You can't handle it.
I had to look after the children.
There was another problem.
What's your shoe size?
How about playing golf tomorrow?
You're a terrible person.
We ate fresh fruit after dinner.
Tom bought one for himself.
It's complex.
Tom drank a lot more than I did.
I know you want to go home.
He told her that she was right.
My rent has gone up.
Do I have to wait long?
Students should make use of the books in the library.
I just want to be alone.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
He asked her out on a date.
Do you feel like going swimming?
We don't have enough money for a taxi.
The sun is rising.
The theory is not accepted.
I get out of the hospital next week.
You can have breakfast between 7 and 9.
I don't know what you're complaining about.
I'm never in a hurry.
What are you talking about?
You're sleepy.
Tom needs to be at today's meeting.
We need sleep.
Do you love your country?
I am frying fish.
Get serious.
What's wrong with those?
Can you tell me what this is?
Don't put anything on the box.
I'm sure Tom had a good reason.
I feel strongly about this.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Tom watched Mary cook dinner.
This is a sensitive issue.
Show me how to do that.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Your pronunciation is excellent.
My friend helped me.
He's a fast walker.
Don't you know his name?
He's always at home on Mondays.
What kind of music does Tom listen to?
I will say something about it.
I don't care about your past.
Get in the car.
Here's your pudding.
I was thinking about joining the army.
Can't you do something to help me?
Do you mind if I sit here?
Didn't your parents teach you manners?
What were you doing down there?
Don't let them do this.
Dinner will be ready soon.
This hat is too big for you.
Why can't I go?
He lost his temper and hit the boy.
A new building is being built in front of my house.
He almost never gets angry.
Please fill in this application form.
The two of us did that together.
I'll check your vision.
My neighbors left yesterday.
They awarded her a gold metal for her achievement.
You're blushing like a schoolgirl.
My bicycle is in need of repair.
Tom doesn't want Mary to participate.
We'll die sooner or later.
I want you to know that I can't be there tomorrow.
No one has an explanation.
Who gave you this information?
Live free or die.
I'm with exactly who I want to be with.
Tom poisoned Mary's dog.
It is a book.
Tom won't kiss Mary.
I don't like kids.
I haven't heard from Tom in a year.
I burned the cake.
I can't believe he kissed you.
Leave me.
How did you get hurt?
Put your books away.
Don't count on them.
No casualties were reported.
I protested.
I can't believe he kissed you.
About how much money do you have?
I want a knife to cut the rope with.
You had better take an umbrella with you today.
Put it in the closet.
Maybe he likes you.
I hope you stop telling me lies.
I see fear in your eyes.
Who was this picture painted by?
He's on his way home.
Send the kids to bed.
I worked as hard as I could so I didn't fail.
I want to write all of this down.
It is a very strange letter.
His absence was due to the storm.
This is a mistake.
The coach gave his team a pep talk before the game started.
What has become of the book I put here a few minutes ago?
It's important that you tell the truth.
He complains of not having enough time to read.
We have to get to the hospital.
I've been waiting for the bus for three hours.
Did Tom go alone?
He continued walking for some time.
I can barely remember what my grandfather looked like.
This is a picture.
I don't know what to do about it.
We bought a new washer.
He left the room when I came in.
I'll say what I have to say.
He looks like his father.
The snowstorm continued.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a parody.
Have you been told why we didn't hire you?
You're so romantic.
Could I have a screwdriver?
Her beauty is incomparable.
He has friends from many different walks of life.
They forgot to wake me up.
It's bedtime.
Japanese people tend to think that way.
The baby is fast asleep.
I'll be counting on you to bring a salad.
Ask him for advice.
I don't understand French.
I just don't want you to catch my cold.
Tom went down to the basement.
You'll be crying before long.
What do you say to calling it a day?
I lowered my meat consumption.
I'm afraid we can't rule out the possibility that she may have the disease.
The sun is rising now.
Everybody ought to do this.
You're powerful.
I just wanted to go to college.
I've been waiting for such a long time.
I hope you know what this is.
Shape up or ship out!
Do you think this is some kind of game?
I have to go and have an X-ray tomorrow.
It's getting dark.
What would life be without hope?
I wish you had come with us.
I think Tom is pulling your leg.
What else have you got going on?
There's something happening here that I don't quite understand.
It's so exciting.
She held him by the sleeve.
Sixty percent of Japanese adult males drink alcoholic beverages on a regular basis.
The dog was hit by a car.
We're not getting married.
What is it you want me to do?
He is absorbed in his work.
The risks are too great.
Today is election day in Poland.
I won't shut up.
I couldn't take that risk.
Help Tom to load the truck.
My boyfriend isn't a loser.
I don't like being on my own.
His ideas never earned him even one penny.
I have a few friends.
She likes no one and no one likes her.
It's not for everybody.
The local coffee shop was replaced by a Starbucks.
She was advised by him to stop smoking.
I thought you'd want it back.
I wish this was all over.
I'm not sure if Tom does that anymore.
I will speak to him alone.
I'm downloading the pictures now.
I am quite ignorant of their plan.
The boy lay listening to the radio.
He was found mysteriously murdered.
I strongly suggest you visit Kyoto.
Don't fall asleep.
We were friends.
Who would you like to speak with?
Is your homework done?
One of them is a spy.
They arrived too soon.
I'm not buying it.
Tom's goal is to own a home before he's thirty.
I wonder if I can do it again.
Did I hurt you?
The president takes office tomorrow.
I know I'm alone on this.
Why are you saying goodbye?
Do you know his name?
I don't remember any of their names.
I lost my wedding ring.
How was your stay?
He's ready to go.
I know you don't like me.
I feel betrayed.
Hang your coat on the hook.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
How do you know they're looking for us?
He goes to Karuizawa every year.
We want to buy a house in Boston.
Do you have any idea what happened?
Let's do this later.
It isn't on the menu.
The sky grew darker and darker.
I see the boy.
He is as tall as my father.

I'm sorry I hurt you.
Can you beat that?
I'm getting tired of losing.
This is a difficult problem to solve.

You're not very funny.
You're too young to know what a slide rule is.

What are you reading?
I would like to read some books about Lincoln.
How long did you stay at the party?

She heard him cry.
I was just making sure.
Many thanks.
They say that he is the richest person in the world.

What kind of books does Tom read?
He was fully clothed.
You're invited.
Won't you have some tea?

I'm glad you weren't here.
I'm going to teach you some karate.
Over 100 people were present at the party.
The weather is very hot.
I want many things.

Tom looks pretty nervous.
What's the point of not eating?
The storm prevented us from arriving on time.
Why did I trust you?
He has a headache.
I appreciate your enthusiasm.
Why did you let Tom go?
He shoved the letter into his pocket.
What's the meaning of that?
What does your dog look like?
He made a wisecrack.
I caught him by the arm.
A man is more or less what he looks like.
It's quiet.
He turned on the radio.
I can't see the road signs in this fog.
I worry too much.
My mother was in the hospital during the summer.
Talk to my boss.
They had been saving money for the trip for a year.
I want to arrive at Kennedy Airport early in the afternoon.
Give me the ball.
I know Tom was angry.
He seems to have been rich.
I left it unlocked.
He pinched and scraped for many years to save money.
We don't know why he had to leave.
I'd have waited for you.
I don't want to raise false hopes.
You must be careful.
Tom said he knew Mary.
My sister often cries.
That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard.
What do you like to do?
I don't want to be tied to one company.
Do you mind if I join in?
That sweater looks good on you.
Do you have a retirement plan?
How can you be so sure?
He could not walk any further.
This is awful.
We have more pressing things to discuss.
Tom burst into laughter.
Your son is a genius.
There isn't much furniture in my room.
Try this cake.
I waited for Tom outside.
Why can't you be more like your brother?
Tom is the tallest in his family.
I bet you're wondering how this works.
Do you talk to your cats?
I'm afraid I've offended you.
I went into the town in search of a good restaurant.
My new car is red.
What time does the store open?
My success was largely due to luck.
Let's get the party rolling.
Isn't that annoying?
You don't want to be late for practice.
I want to ask you something.
We're glad you're here.
It's much more complicated than that.
Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who didn't need to do that.
Be discreet.
I hope everything works out.
I bet we'll have a test today.
Why am I not surprised?
Honesty is not always the best policy.
You must not invade the privacy of others.
Do you like your coworkers?
Is it OK if I hug you?
I remember what you said the other day.
Cuff him.
I didn't know this.
You have to go alone.
I should've said that.
I heard voices.
I'm sorry.
What are some foods you can eat to lower your cholesterol?
I was a volunteer for two afternoons.
I'm restless.
I'm sick of being sick.
Stay calm.

She left her children.
Don't think about the price.
He hid his emotions and pretended to be enthusiastic.
They fell into each other's arms.
Have you ever eaten whale meat?
She made it plain that she wanted to go to college.
I would never question his honesty.
Could you lend me the book?
Do you have to do this right now?
I know who you want to talk to.
I'll call you at seven.
I'll go see.
He treats me like a child.
It's something my mother used to do.
Have you met the Jacksons?
You looked exhausted.
I would rather feed my dog before we eat.
The performance began at 8:00.
I ask your forgiveness.
It's a long story.
You're old.
You can see the whole park from the restaurant.
Tom lives in a house on the edge of the village.
How much for half a kilo?
He is unmarried.
This book has a lot of pictures.
It was dark in the room.
I work during the night.
You really should do that.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
She stopped picking daisies.
We need to finish what we started.
That's what's crazy.
I can't get along with him.
Go home.
I shouldn't have done that without permission.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Lock your doors.
They're tired.
Who forced you to do that?
No one's home.
She advised him of the date for the next meeting.
Do your best.
I think my parents know.
People usually become famous at the cost of their privacy.
Take the wheel.
We did it.
I can read your mind.
We need our demands to be met.
I showered before breakfast.
He keeps his youth by jogging.
I hear someone singing.
There are few books without misprints.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
It's different.
He failed the entrance exam.
I thought you'd left.
You'll have a rough time.
I think that's where Tom is.
Could you tell me how to get to Park Street?
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
I think that wouldn't be a good idea.
The box was open and empty.
I'm bringing home a pizza.
You don't know how much I wanted to do that.
Some of the girls laughed.
He has a car.
Tom is alone in the forest.
It is dangerous to jump onto a moving train.
It's very kind of you.
He is a writer.
There are five patients in the waiting room.
Everyone likes them.
I never get tired of talking.
Tell me again how much money you have.
They ganged up on him.
I will accompany you.
Did I just do that?
You should have worked harder.
Iron is a useful metal.
The money is gone.
I have three choices.
He explained the political background of the war on TV.
Mary slapped Tom.
A mosquito just bit me.
I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
They couldn't help us.

This word comes from Latin.

I don't know how to do that.

She advised him to read more books.
That cut on your arm looks pretty serious.
He managed to pass his driving test even though he was a poor driver.
This is a very interesting question.
I wish I could've stayed longer.
A horse passed my house.
It has an unpleasant taste.
Keep away from the dog.
Tom thought he was going to die.
No one said anything.
That's your duty.
Both spellings are correct.
I didn't steal it.
Tom didn't accept my apologies.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
You said you were going to buy a new car.
I ran ahead to warn everybody.
What he's saying is actually true.
I can't imagine what you've gone through.
Are you happy?
I owe what I am today to my uncle.
I miss you badly.
Japan has undergone a drastic change as a result of industrialization.
That is how the accident occurred.
Tom lost his balance.
You can't quit now.
I can't believe you did that by yourself.
I felt the same.
Blue lines on the map designate rivers.
I didn't see the fire hydrant.
Tomorrow is my day off.
We knelt down to pray.
I'm proud of you all.
I want the whole world to know that we're in love.
What teams were playing?
He's your son.
I live next to a dam.
How much is that going to cost me?
I'm proud of that.
The boys were injured.
I fell in love in an unlikely place.
Please forgive me for not answering your letter.
The guests are in the living room.
They fit each other so perfectly.
I kept on reading.
I'll handle it.
Are any seats still available?
He risked his life to save her.
I'm reluctant to help Tom.
She gave him a lot of money.
Tom has begun writing a new book.
What did you do?
She went to rehab and straightened herself out.
You're very direct.
Tom let us go.
We haven't been invited yet.
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
We can't trust anyone now.
Buffaloes have big horns.
That's a good excuse.
What were you two talking about?
Come up here.
Soon it'll be winter.
He's used to speaking in public.
Many people work in industrial towns.
The soldiers lost the courage to fight.
How far is it from here to your school?
The people protested against the low altitude flight training.
Tom isn't easy to say no to.
We weren't prepared for the assault.
I think you have my umbrella.
They don't listen to me.
What would you do if Tom asked you to do that?
He gorged himself on ice cream.
We broke up.
They told me that I was overqualified for this job.
I had to wait twenty minutes for the next bus.
An illustration may make the point clear.
Do you go to church?
I don't think anybody can help me now.
She made me hurry.
I like seafood.
We didn't hear you come in.
I need to sleep.
I'm still not sure I can do that.
It won't take so long.
I won't say a word.
I'll be with you in a moment.
I think we need to have a talk.
Why do I believe you?
Get me some water.
I have no idea how long it'll take.
I'll pay for it.
Will six o'clock suit you?
I can't force you to do anything.
No less than three hundred dollars was needed for the work.
I want you to tell me about your trip.
I prefer to travel alone.
You must learn to adapt.

Don't touch my car.

He is after a better job.
They're jittery.
I can't get that out of my mind.
I can't get rid of this cold.
I read it to my family.
No one uses that word anymore.
Our feelings towards him are mixed.
Would you mind coming with me?
You can sit down if you want.
I don't think you'll die today.
What a smart idea!
There has been no rain for two weeks.
She can handle it.
I want to scratch my nose.
I just had a talk with your doctor.
That sounded like a gunshot.
I was burned.
I know it's a great opportunity.
Keep children away from the pond.
I'm ashamed of my past.
I have no interest whatsoever in eating English food.
I know that would make you happy.
I'll leave Boston tonight.
You're in over your head.
I'm sure everything's OK.
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
I thought I was cool.
Is this ethical?
I'm accustomed to this.
I can't let you enter without a pass.
My grandfather takes a walk every morning.
Don't ask me about my private life.
It can't be a coincidence.
The three were arrested.
That isn't the case in Japan.

About how much money do you need?
Did I hurt your feelings?
I'm staying over at my friend's place.
I've got to get back to work.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Tom writes very well.
I love barbecue.
Did you turn the stove off?
I want to see the ocean.
I really don't want to talk about this.
We often have barbecues and pool parties.
He thought it over and decided not to go.
An eagle is flying in the sky.
When did he say he would come?
Do you look up to your parents?
We arrived tired and hungry.
He was the only one not invited to the party.
Tom wants to learn to sing in French.
Why do I have to know this stuff?

Where's my room?
My sister still lives with our parents.
Come whenever you want.
He finally achieved what he set out to do.
I want these.
Tom said he'd play tennis with us.
Mother was afraid I would get dirty.
He will not listen to me.
She read the article over and over again.
Can you get by on your wages?
Could you check the tire pressure?
You can sit here if you want to.
Thank you for decorating my house.
I don't think I have a choice.
Do it the way he tells you to.
I'm happy enough.
Some of us hate it.
Do you want something to read?
We take that very seriously.
Digital music is becoming more and more popular.
What's your theory on what happened?
She lives in the country.
I love what I'm doing here.
I want a boat that'll take me far away from here.

I'm correct.
Her only hobby is collecting stamps.
How about running?
He gave away all his money to charity.
I need a tissue.
Is he really the man you're looking for?
Can you will yourself to fall asleep?
I had the flu last month.
Why don't you sit here?
I'll kill him.
My mom will kill me.
It wasn't very fun.
How do you know that Tom did it?
Do you have your keys?
I feel like taking a rest.
You said you were going to handle it.
I run every morning.
What are you implying?
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
We saw the lady carried away to the hospital.
Ive made a few corrections.
I'm going to go out and take a walk.
This seems excessive.
My backyard can hold more than ten people.
I think we should do that today.
She forgave him for killing her father.
I fell in love with a girl I met in Boston last year.
Tom found me a taxi.
Do you want to be an actor in a movie?
Don't you do this to me.
You can call me this afternoon if you want.
You should not go alone.
Tom has to pay three hundred dollars more.
We're pooped.
Tom offered to pay for the damages.
I find that offensive.
You should stay away from Tom.
My car isn't powerful enough.
I ordered a book from London.
I had to find another solution.
The pain went away because I took the pills.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
She advised me where to stay.
This is where you're wrong.
I bet you're busy.
Please push this button at once in case of emergency.

Honesty pays in the long run.
You know the drill.
I only read the first three chapters.
I'd suggest we don't go down that road.

I was a bit emotional.
No one believes him.
He may be sick in bed.
What don't you have?
They're not following me.
My father gave a nice watch to me.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
I can't settle for this boring life.
What are your plans for tonight?
I think that's an important point.
Don't try to be a hero.
I'll teach you what you need to know.
This museum is worth a visit.
We studied French.
Tom said he didn't know the answer.
I worked in Boston for three years.
He didn't wash for a week.
This camera is Tom's.
Tom obeyed.
She is living in the middle of nowhere.
I'm a normal guy.
Tom and Mary went outside.
What's your husband's name?
Stop calling me Tom.
I want you to do this.
I'm not avoiding you.
They do not waste anything nor throw anything away.
We're not going to lie to you.
I was thinking about asking her out.
I never thought Tom would hit Mary.
That's not good enough for Tom.
Calm down. We're just a few minutes from the hospital.
He acted behind the manager's back.
You needed me.
This is all unnecessary.
How old were you when you did that?
None of them wanted to talk.
I couldn't have solved this case without you.
He usually comes home late.
Is this all right?
The roses in the garden are blooming.
My parents objected to my studying abroad.
Tom said that he was really glad Mary moved to Boston.
That's happened to me many times.
Are you trying to grow a beard?
This is not good.
The hailstones were as big as tennis balls.
It works well.
This neighborhood is very scary.
I think it's Tom's motorcycle.
We need more people like Tom.
A cry arose from the crowd.
She's nice to me.
His manners are not those of a gentleman.
Prices are rising.
I only found out about that today.
How did you get in?
Believe me when I tell you that I don't love you.
Tom gave me this watch.
Tom could get up to three years in prison.
His house is surrounded by trees.
I want to look like her.
I started getting ready.
You gave me your word.
The refrigerator door was open.
Tom isn't your brother.
This is silly.
Do you have a boyfriend?
He is suffering from a headache.
You were supposed to do that yesterday.
This will have to be replaced.
That is where you are wrong.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't do that anymore.
You don't look that good.
I've been working.
You gotta get more organized.
We want something new.
Tom yawned.
I hate the tie you're wearing.
She's two years younger than him.
How many payments will it take to pay off this loan?
I don't ever want to leave Boston.
I know all about you.
Father is angry with me.
I don't have as much experience as you.
Here we are!
I wanted to talk about it.
He noticed straight away.
He ordered them to release the prisoner.
They always go skiing in the winter.
We just want to live in peace.
I don't care if it's a bit cold.
Tom was a truck driver before he became a race car driver.
I had to see you again.
Don't shout like that. I can hear you perfectly.
I was at a job interview.
I just want to be your friend.
What a drag!
Don't blame me for your mistakes.
I'm accustomed to cold weather.
I've got exactly 13 dollars in my pocket.
Tom said you wanted to talk to me.
Do what he says.
You've misunderstood.
The three gunshot victims are in critical condition.
I have a Canadian neighbor.
This lawn mower runs on gasoline.
He has a natural bent for music.
We were thinking of asking you to join our company.
I didn't get even one letter from her.

Loosen up.
All major credit cards are accepted.
Everything's wrong.
I bought a new television.
I'm really happy for you.
My mother always gets up earlier in the morning.
Please turn left at the next light.
Let's play baseball!
I know what Tom likes to drink.
I won't cry.
He works as hard as any student.
My father disapproved of my going to the concert.
You have no right to do this.
They saw us as they were getting off the train.
He began to look for work.
I want you to be my partner.
Would you be so kind as to shut that window?
Why didn't we think of that before?
He abuses his authority.
I have been busy today.
Can you teach me how to ride a horse?
I never said I was an artist.
He is suffering from loss of memory.
I don't have time to be sick.
Let's not forget to do that.
Is it always like this?
There's very little paper left.
I decided to tell him that I love her.
I hate mosquitoes.
Tom isn't old enough to smoke.
I had to get away from here.
I want to trust you.
There's somebody coming up the stairs.
Who left this mess in the toilet?
His sister looks young.
She has a beautiful tan.
She called him a fool.
Tom lost weight very quickly.
What are you going to do during the summer holidays?
It was very funny.
Each student has a locker.
I had expected him at the meeting.
Lincoln was a good politician and a smart lawyer.
I didn't know you then.
I'm a college student.
You can't take it with you.
I'll be grateful to you if you can do that for me.
My tailor is rich.
I'm used to the heat.
She got the money from him even though he said that he wouldn't give it to her.
I prefer to work at night.
I'm the teacher.
How is it that you're always so full of energy?
You could well be right.
Write down the facts needed to convince other people.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
They were sunbathing on the beach.
Compare the signatures.
A truck was standing in the middle of the road.
There's something you have to know.
I don't know the reason for her absence.
He saved us all.
It was here that I saw her.
He's getting soft in his old age.
Give me a little time to think it over.
I can't stand it anymore.
I do not read books.
I'm going to be there.
I can sing.
Save yourself.
I'm delighted to hear that.
Be ruthless.
Is everyone all right?
Tom continued talking for a while.
I know you aren't stupid enough to believe that.
Why are you always so happy?
Let me get that for you.
I was horrified.
Luck doesn't exist.
Why did Tom cancel his trip?
I crossed the river by boat.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't walk alone after dark.
You have to respect the old.
Are you as tall as me?
I only have American coins in my pocket right now.
Are you guys armed?
He made up his mind to go there.
I hope Tom proves me wrong.
I went to the park to play tennis.
What foreign countries would you like to visit?
We're working.
He was alone in the room.
I don't have anything to give to you.
He said something to my friend.
She has a pretty doll.
They stayed awake all night.
Somebody's inside the house.
Get in the boat.
I am so sick.
My boss was very strict.
Don't act surprised.
I want to know what to expect.
He promised to keep it to himself.
He has quite a few records.
They're special.
Is Tom lazy?
You have a point.
Would you like to come with us?
I love to fish.
You shouldn't be doing that.
Are you on your way home?
That's what I'm thinking.
He was slain in battle.
Will this satisfy you?
He told me everything.
Can I see you a second outside?
How many times a week do you eat rice?
I saw a movie for the first time in two years.
I live alone in this house.
We need to do what we can.
She called while I was out.
We see each other every day.
You're psychic.
I didn't know you were a dentist.
Come and warm yourself by the fire.
Are you old enough to drive?
I appreciate all you've done for me.
Is there anything I should know?
Do you realize how late it's gotten?
The food was wonderful.
We're quite certain of that.
Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
You owe me a beer.
Which is your favorite team?
Tom is a perfect stranger to me.
I am not quite sure if we can meet your requirements.
The earth is much larger than the moon.
I cut up all but one of my credit cards.
What do you think this sentence means?
Do you really think it's bad?
I just don't get it.
Tom is drinking apple juice.
I want you to be quiet.
This is what I wanted.
I prefer to do it on my own.
I held the conch to my ear and heard the ocean inside.
I want a licensed guide who speaks English.
We aren't Canadians.
You have more energy than I do.
The answer's yes.
You're great at this.
Return immediately.
They have no choice.
I'm all out of ideas.
Study hard so you don't fail.
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
Are you blackmailing me?
Are you still waiting for the bus?
We need to get going.
She accused him of stealing her money.
That's what I do all day.
I can't help laughing at him.
You can't smoke in here.
He is no longer living here.
I'm sorry I've caused so many problems.
I just want someone to talk to.
Industrial countries require a lot of skilled labor.
Do you give to charity?
That is rather unexpected.
Tom pulled a box from under the bed.
She went to the market to buy fresh vegetables.
I've come a long way.
I feel refreshed.
Do you care for classical music?
Tom didn't call.
I don't care about the money.
The dog was frozen to death.
Everything is now ready for you.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
Tom called Mary every day.
It would be nice to get married.
Blame it on the weather.
The mother occasionally reread her son's letter.
She was unconscious for three days.
I want to work with you.
Have you read the leading article in today's paper?
I'm glad you're here today.
We were playing by the rules.
Tom will need these.
He is busy preparing for the trip.
I can't do it alone.
I suppose you know all about it.
You must see it to believe it.
They're not coming.
I have a full-length mirror in my bedroom.
I didn't deserve to go to prison.
Tom slapped Mary on the back.
Life cannot exist without water.
I'm honest.
Does Tom know why?
I told my mom I was gay and it didn't faze her at all.
He failed the entrance exam.
I'd like to set things straight.
Bad news travels quickly.
I failed the tests.
What are we doing today?
What kind of historian are you?
I come to school by bus.
Did she look in her bag?
I've got to get back home by midnight.
You can do it any way you like.
I have only half as many books as he does.
Here is a list of things you should avoid eating.
Two and four are even numbers.
The oven is still warm.
Tom's sad.
It was a fine day and there were no clouds in the sky.
He winced as the nurse pushed the needle into his arm.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
I can't believe you're still hungry.
I've got pliers in my car.
You should take my advice.
I used to collect coasters.
He is about thirty.
I feel relaxed with you.
How do you get to work?
Can we at least sit down?
Were there any problems?
I can't think of his name just now.
I have to buy some new shoes.
She woke him up.
Almost no one believed him.
Beware of falling rocks!
I thought you were older than me.
Don't you want to go out?
Can we get started now?
American generals believed they could win an easy victory.
He gave me his phone number.
Why does it have to be me?
She fell in love with him at first sight.
I'm still your friend.
How is your daughter?
The dog is on the chair.
Tom wanted to talk with Mary.
I was a bit unlucky.
He is fond of this kind of music.
Are you seriously thinking about buying a computer from that store?
It was stupid of you to believe him.
Those who know him speak well of him.
This is depressing.
I admire Tom's perseverance.
He likes soccer a lot.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
He became a national hero.
Time flies like an arrow.
I know a man who can help.
That's why I don't like you.
This tea tastes good.
I will do anything for him.
You're imagining things.
This operation is simple.
She's two years younger than him.
Why is this computer so slow?
How many different pieces are there in Japanese chess?
Tom seems nice.
He was kind enough to tell me the truth.
Is the fish market open?
I don't even have a girlfriend.
Who is in the house?
I'm not armed.
We were always together.
We spoke to each other in French.
I don't want to eat lunch now.
I regret that I couldn't go with Tom.
I'll follow you to the ends of the earth.
We're making a big mistake.
I met my teacher on the way to the station.
She did so out of curiosity.
She is trying to prove the existence of ghosts.
Do you drink beer?
I suggest you leave.
I'm a football player.
What do you think of Mary's new dress?
Her eyes were filled with tears.
I didn't do what I was told to do.
You're good.
Did you like the meal?
This gentleman asks interesting questions.
I had to beg my friends to come.
They all can drive.
Who told you that we should do that?
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Tomorrow will be another day.
Tom told Mary that he'd go to Boston in October.
I didn't think you'd be so late.
My favorite kind of music is jazz.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
What scared Tom the most was the thought that he might not be able to walk again.
That is not your knife.
I must give Tom that.
It was the only way to go.
That's only part of it.
They ate marshmallows.
Is it broken?
I made a regrettable mistake.
Don't stand next to the window.
I don't know where he comes from.
Give Tom some room.
I'm just a little dizzy.
They attained their goal.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
Tom said you were lonely.
The view here is breathtaking.
I'm ready if you are.
He went home at six.
The sea is blue.
Tom wiped his face with a towel.
What do you want to drink?
We have no school today.
I am seeing my uncle tomorrow.
You're reliable.
Tom traveled to Boston.
I cannot accept your present.
He works long hours.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
I want you to return to your seat.
That was pathetic.
He's not stupid.
She was in America last month.
I go every year.
You are free to leave any time you wish.
Wouldn't that be something?
Lets play video games or something.
No one escaped alive.
Dog food is getting more expensive.
Let's stop wasting time.
We're not happy.
I think this is a bad idea.
Why would anybody want to kill you?
Tom couldn't finish his dinner.
I don't have a beard.
You'd better not see her now.
I think the KGB was implicated.
Is this wine?
My father is very angry with me.
He loves her.
Tom is a moron.
It's not mine.
I thought I recognized Tom.
Who's driving?
One person more or less doesn't make much difference.
They had no children.
Nobody was allowed to go out of the room.
Both girls laughed.
All are welcomed.
I cried when Tom told me about that.
This hurts more than you can imagine.
I studied all week for that quiz.
He owes much of his success to his wife.
"How did Tom get in here? ""He came in through the window that you left unlocked."""
I want you to get off my back.
I can't believe it's true.
I need something else.
I went to the hospital to see my uncle.
You're wanted by the police.
I said I liked it.
Who's at home?
He never gets invited to parties.
She wants to read a book.
I caught a carp in a net.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
What did you expect to happen?
What a nice house!
I'm on the way to the store.
Scientists are slowly piecing together the mechanism of aging.
What could go wrong?
No one is allowed to go there.
What time does the bus leave?
I'd like to talk to the doctor alone for a moment.
Who did you have lunch with?
You need to let go.
Excuse me for being late.
He's an expert with a slingshot.
I'm going away for the summer holiday.
I can't catch my breath.
Why don't you trust me?
What did you find?
This was built some 500 years ago.
I don't even know who has stolen what.
That's not important right now.
We sat on a bench in the park.
Enjoy your trip.
I buried it.
It's not really necessary.
What do you want me to do?
Tobacco was one of their major crops.
Where is the bus terminal?
A home is more than a mere building.
The coffee is too bitter for me to drink.
He bought a new pair of gloves.
It wasn't interesting at all.
He has more money than he can spend.
Isn't that what you want?
He's afraid of making mistakes.
Don't you get it?
How old is this stuff?
Carry on with your work.
He was in pain.
I can't help you now.
Take an umbrella with you in case it rains.
How long will you be staying?
I saw him go out.
They need the money.
You promised not to be rude to me any more.
I got married 8 years ago.
Driving through that snowstorm was a nightmare.
We played cards last night.
She doesn't speak my language.
I've changed. I'm not the same man I used to be.
Tom looked at Mary and blushed.
I want you to tell the truth.
The GDP of China still pales in comparison with that of the US.
I appreciate you coming here.
Who do you want to speak to?
I see your cat in the garden.
I figured I had enough money.
You've been cleared of all charges.
Tom is level-headed.
Your performance was very good.
You'd better go in person.
You've done well here.
I like the sound of your voice.
You don't have to tell me this.
Tom already knows this.
Did I miss the turn?
I'm going for a run. Do you want to come?
I'd like your permission to use it.
No one told me that she had failed.
I got dressed in a hurry.
They are our guests.
Don't be so pessimistic.
She got through her work before five.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
They can't hear you.
Tom spilled the milk.
Thanks for all you've done for me.
I am almost scared to talk with you.
Tom wants to come.
Were you able to solve the problem?
I didn't do anything all day.
He was found lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
Women usually live longer than men.
I found your diary.
I'm very strict.
The bus should be here by now.
Can I come some other time?
The rumor was not based on facts.
Tom scares everybody.
I want to spend more time doing things that make me happy.
Do you live in this dorm?
I can do this with you or without you.
I know that she is cute.
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
I play bass in a jazz band.
I was overwhelmed.
I can't believe what an idiot I've been.
Whose guitar is this?
What does it feel like?
Tom wanted to cry.
I must get it fixed.
I was there that day.
Don't do that.
I want to go over a few things with you.
Country people are often afraid of strangers.
I know how we can have some fun.
Is her story true?
I will keep your advice in mind.
The thief stubbed his toe on the door.
How can Tom not understand this?
I'm not the one who should go.
A note was attached to the document with a paper clip.
We were there.
The party was a success.
Luck comes to those who look for it.
Delicious refreshments were served.
Bring it back when you're done.
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
You're such a jerk.
They'll be rooting for you.
Why are you so quiet?
My uncle who lives in Boston visited us last week.
I stayed home to rest.
Tom has been quiet all day.
Can you read music?
I think you know what I think.
My uncle lived abroad for many years.
He is too young to go there alone.
I don't intend to answer any questions.
"We have to do this now. ""There's no time."""
I really don't want to sit in the back of the bus.
Are you a registered voter?
Is there anyone in the room?
Miami is the biggest city in Florida.
I usually pay my bills on time.
I'm not a great photographer.
I enjoy being with you.
Would you like me to repeat the question?
The thermometer is an instrument for measuring temperature.
I have an old car.
Here's my phone number.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
We'll make up for the loss.
This is no longer for sale.
I'm really not interested in history.
She stabbed him in the back.
They de-iced the bridge with salt.
She bought him a camera.
We don't even know if it's true.
I loved going to the beach.
Why are you worried?
There is no other way.
Tom also speaks French.
She filled the vase with water.
I'd like to know exactly how much money is in my account.
I heard strange noises coming from his bedroom.
It began to snow.
I'd like to be your friend.
The contents of the four registers are preserved by the called subroutine.
You're very resourceful.
I don't think French is difficult.
She met him only recently.
Do you think your money is safe in a bank?
I'll see you in the morning.
Would you do something for me?
You're very emotional.
Do whatever it takes to get the job done.
Are you sure that you want to go there?
Tom doesn't know how strong you are.
I came to warn you not to do that.
She picked up a stone.
I didn't take it.
It's my treat.
Don't you ever say that again.
The hardest thing in life is knowing which bridges to cross and which bridges to burn.
She told me an interesting story.
You have been warned.
Clothes make the man.
That's alright.
Winter is coming soon.
Tom is buying bananas.
It is still unclear what caused the accident.
This is a great apartment.
He is good at rugby.
Don't cry. Everything will be OK.
She looked back on her childhood.
You and I have something in common.
I can't believe you're here.
I remember it.
She came close to drowning.
It must be so hard for you.
Smoking does you more harm than good.
I won't say anything about that.
I met your father yesterday.
When did this come about?
It's acceptable.
He suspects me of telling a lie.
Tom attempted to swim across the river.
He took charge of the family business after his father died.
You should be a writer.
Tom eats a lot of Chinese food.
I've never felt this way about anyone before.
Did you like this book?
Where did the bee sting you?
She lived a happy life.
Shakespeare created many famous characters.
I wish I were as young as you.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I've made up my mind to go.
Hold my hand.
Tom comes here every weekend.
How are your parents?
Anything could happen.
I'm beginning to lose patience with Tom.
You need to stop saying no to Tom.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm sorry to see Tom go.
I just don't want our luck to run out.
The doctor told me to eat fewer high-calorie snacks.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
Don't talk to me about religion.
It gets better.
I'm about to tell you the answer.
We've done a lot.
We hardly ever see you around here anymore.
Photography is now considered a new form of art.
A dog is barking.
You'll never be young again.
He accused me of being a liar.
His guess turned out to be right.
What did you say?
Could you please be quiet?
I'm sure that this is a fresh water fish.
I like this chair.
I hid it in my sock drawer.
Is this all for real?
It is not easy to catch a hare with your bare hands.
Why don't you let us go?
She divorced her husband.
I'm quite certain I don't want to be married to you.
Why are we being punished?
The soup's cold.
You don't need to tell me.
Turn off the light before you go to bed.
Money is welcome everywhere.
I will get through with my homework before he comes.
Tom likes making paper airplanes.
You're all alone.
Our city police have a new campaign targeting drunken driving.
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
Don't ask so many questions.
Did you come here alone?
Why are you alone?
You can't be in two places at once.
Stop shouting.
I'd like to have your answer right away.
What do you need to buy?
He could not sleep because of the heat.
We talked about this yesterday.
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
I'll help you prevent that from happening again.
You're not very tidy.
Take precautions.
You must be very proud.
I think you look great.
I'm sure I can persuade Tom.
Your car has a broken taillight.
I can't figure out what's causing the problem.
I have good news in store for you.
I didn't like the result.
I left it on the table.
I made some corrections.
What's today's exchange rate?
Tom's tie is yellow.
You've seen what this machine can do.
Tom took another sip.
Tom put a bandage on Mary's finger.
My association with them didn't last long.
You're a very important person to me.
I'm not busy anymore.
I have nothing to say against it.
I want to buy my car back.
Why are you holding my hands?
I'm sure you'll do very well.
We don't want to wait.
I stopped the car.
I think you'll be able to do it.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I think you'd better go on a diet.
Here is my key.
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
You should go home.
I ran for mayor.
Mother Teresa was given the Nobel prize.
That will be done this week.
I was afraid of being put into a closet.
The rule holds good in this case.
We must go.
I wouldn't know where to start.
We had to push our way through the crowd.
Do you believe it now?
I think you know that's inappropriate.
I've warned you before about this.
The black umbrella is Tom's.
I've seen a lot of changes.
It is getting dark outdoors.
She was in time for the bus.
All inventions grow out of necessity.
Don't forget about me.
I can't understand what you said at all.
I don't know what her name is.
It was very scary.
I suppose I've got to get my feet wet sometime.
Do you have a lot of free time?
She hasn't cleaned her room yet.
She wrote to him to tell him that she loved him.
He got up and left in the middle of the discussion.
I don't think Tom will come back.
What's in front of you?
Many people act like that.
There was just barely enough time.
A full moon is shining bright in the sky.
Hand me the hammer.
Who is currently the richest person in the world?
I forgot your phone number.
The bad weather delayed the plane's departure by two hours.
It was crowded here all last week.
A strange sound was heard from behind the door.
We're not dating.
I'll pay you tomorrow.
You were so young then.
Are you the one who saved me?
They are approaching.
I'm not married yet.
My father cut wood with a saw.
Tom is going to stay there as long as possible.
I never see her without thinking of her mother.
Lemons contain citric acid.
That's how he invented the machine.
My friends invited me to dinner.
He has been sick in bed all week.
Large amounts of money were spent on the new bridge.
I want to keep my room as neat as possible.
Are you falling for me?
I made that decision.
These peaches aren't very sweet.
Tom borrowed a car from a friend.
I do know that.
You're not supposed to eat on the job.
She gave him some food.
She gets about with the help of a walker.
That's how I would've done it.
It smells like bleach.
I want you to go home.
It's funny.
Don't you think so?
I don't think you'd understand it.
A new serial will begin in next month's issue.
This book is a fascinating read.
They are not very different from anybody else.
You're doing it right.
I have to pick up my son at 2:30.
Life is a mystery.
It wasn't me. It was Tom.
I corrected myself.
There are many more people than I expected.
I want you to sing.
Don't blame me for your mistakes.
Here's what I learned.
Who do you think I am?
Let me rest a little.
Call me when it's done.
Nobody suspected anything.
Is that for me?
I am from Spain.
I was just in time for the last train.
He asked me to do it.
He's your father.
Do you still want to give me a hug?
Someone gave me this.
He gave me authority to fire them.
I want new business cards.
I stayed there for three days.
You're going to love our food.
I think of you as a friend.
I'm not giving you any more money.
Those shoes are old fashioned.
I never believed it.
Do you know who invented the microscope?
I can't really remember.
She is after a better job.
I want to join you.
I didn't write this letter.
Your proposal is a bit extreme.
It won't be long before he is up and about.
The new tunnel will link Great Britain and France.
I just have to make a call.
Is what you told me secret?
I've come to ask you a question.
You're very generous.
Don't let anything stand between you and success.
What do you make of all this?
Tom and Mary both have very few friends.
I live in this house by myself.
I pulled as hard as I could.
I wonder if that's true.
Let me know how it goes.
It isn't just for show.
She lost her locker key while she was swimming in the pool.
I was a prison warden for ten years.
We were so tired that we turned in about 9:00 last night.
What's going on around here?
I'm waiting for the bus.
I don't think you have a choice.
I've taken care of that.
How do I get reimbursed?
Stop bragging.
Tom has no idea what that means.
You need to study harder.
The result remains to be seen.
I take a bath every day.
Why not try it on?
How am I doing so far?
You need to work fast.
You can visit NHK any time.
I left my wallet at home.
I can't get my gloves off.
I know someone you work with.
I have a friend whose father is a lawyer.
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
Tom seemed very impressed.
You can't have both.
He's lazy.
Do you have the vaccine?
Are you sure they can do this?
It is impossible for him to do it in a day.
You shouldn't eat raw snails.
Tom is also studying French.
I am not concerned with this affair.
Who made this song popular?
He had his pocket picked in the crowd.
He's never been in love before.
I'll beat you up!
The sky grew darker and darker.
I love the way you write.
We should not have done that. It was wrong.
What do you think about this outfit?
You'll all die.
I think that went well.
Can I rely on you?
Don't repeat that.
Her feelings are easily hurt.
You ought to keep working while you have your health.
I think what you want is over here.
Is it too big?
Do you wish to go?
Let's put her in charge of that.
Do you think Tom is still home?
I know Tom was early.
I am cold.
I can't do this job without you.
He has a lot of topics for conversation.
How about this one?
I want to do my job the best I can.
You really should try this cake.
I want to try my best for as long as I am physically able to.
Tom took ski lessons.
How much are these shoes?
Losing your health is worse than losing your money.
Have you finished your meal?
Tom and I raised three children.
The money is gone.
I don't need Tom.
There weren't any roses in the garden.
The chairperson has been associated with the organization for ten years.
I'm not ready to do that.
I know Tom is a librarian.
It is obvious that that is a lie.
We'll need a head hunting agency to find the right man for this executive position.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.
They sat in the shade of that big tree.
Did Tom really tell Mary to drink that?
Doing that would be a bad idea.
What are the rules?
Have you already read this book?
You may as well tell me all about it.
She advised him to go there.
This song is very popular in Japan.
Can you read this without your glasses?
I like doing stuff like that.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted him to walk her home.
I've decided to accept the job offer.
Few politicians admit their mistakes.
I just assumed that you wouldn't mind.
What would you do if you had a billion dollars?
You remind me of your father.
I need change for the bus.
Did you miss me?
Your mother is in critical condition.
She gave me a strange look.
When do you go on holiday?
You ran a red light.
He saw it also.
He's a leading authority in his field.
Tie your shoe.
Is she married?
Plastics have taken the place of many conventional materials.
Will you lend me some money?
I got home just before Tom.
What a beautiful day!
I'm pretty sure that I've left the keys to my office in my raincoat pocket.
How did you come up with such a good excuse?
They've changed the rules.
Tell Tom what'll happen to him if he doesn't do it.
I have to hurry!
He likes collecting old coins.
Tom is obviously worried.
Do you speak a foreign language?
We don't do this as often as we used to.
The sun will soon set.
The cat arched its back and stretched itself.
This is probably a bad idea.
The national debt is growing.
The police arrested the suspect.
Do you think I'm too tall?
Are you good at tennis?
I just want you to listen.
Let me find out.
I wonder if he's really sick.
I'll be the last one to do that.
No one will believe you.
How about tonight?
I wasn't very worried.
Don't blame the mistake on her.
It's unlikely that I'll have time to finish this project before next week.
I got a new stereo at that store.
The strange-looking woman was thought to be a witch.
Do you want to see my cat?
He was exiled from his country.
Tom used to be a heavy smoker.
Let's take up this matter after lunch.
He could not answer that question.
I knew Tom was lying to me.
I have nothing in particular to do tomorrow.
Who's taking responsibility for the loss?
The investment firm tricked customers into buying worthless stock.
I'd like to learn to play the harp.
I know Tom is very angry.
We'll never know.
I used to have a motorcycle.
I'd better be on my way.
How much will it be?
I didn't look.
I wish I knew what it was.
Fix this.
Don't get an upset stomach by eating too much.
I'm ready to go.
Keep focused on your work.
I'm not quite happy with the wording of this sentence.
He died an unnatural death.
Why didn't you run away?
I haven't met with Tom recently.
They're armed.
Can you get the door to shut?
I am taking my son to the zoo this afternoon.
She spends a little time each day reading the Bible.
Quit gambling.
He made mistake after mistake.
I don't want to hear about it anymore.
It took me three days to clean the room.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
You're very good.
What would you like to eat?
Get in the car and lock the doors.
I can't carry on like this.
I knew then that I was right.
Shouldn't you take a break?
I prefer plain materials.
What do you have in mind?
He's too drunk.
Why are you worrying about something that doesn't matter so much?
Tom climbed down the ladder.
It was really funny.
The guitar is so expensive that I can't afford it.
Anything that can be misunderstood will be.
Tom doesn't want to talk to you now.
There's no rush.
We discussed the subject at length.
Things have changed.
I'm proud of my family.
That's a little unfair.
The factory uses many complicated machines.
I thought Tom had agreed to do the job.
I want to show you something in the office.
She went shopping at a supermarket.
That's free.
How about your place?
Do you sometimes study in the library?
Tom won a free car.
I didn't have to wait long.
I wouldn't have made that mistake.
I went to your school.
I forgot what his name was.
I'm afraid of dying.
I have no desire to try.
He doesn't take vacations.
Please fill out this form first.
That's why I wanted you to know.
I won't sleep in this room.
The war had united the American people.
Nothing happened between us.
I'd rather stay at home than go out.
I wish you were here with me now.
They're giving away samples free.
The child missed his mother very much.
This word comes from Greek.
It doesn't matter anymore.
Give it to whoever needs it.
This one is the worst.
Tom works with Mary.
I listened to her story.
He decided to become a pilot.
I've never seen so many trees in my life.
Don't ever talk to me again.
Save your strength.
I'll be checking on you.
I've been misunderstood.
I feel the same way about you as you do about me.
Tom will probably wait for you.
The queen shook hands with each player after the game.
I can't save you.
I've been waiting for hours.
She was panting.
She sent me a letter.
We're ready to fight.
You have such beautiful eyes.
Great progress has been made.
I hate it when my parents fight.
I really don't have anything else to say.
They won't find it.
What time do you usually leave for work?
Tom told us to take our time.
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
Do you have a problem with me?
This problem is difficult for me to solve.
I thought you wanted a divorce.
I can give it a shot.
I'm not trying to impress anyone.
I really want you to believe me.
I love blackberries.
Tom refused to tell us anything.
This doesn't fit.
I doubt that's what really happened.
He has a large desk in his small room.
I spend a lot of time listening to music.
He gave me a hard time.
Are you certain that's what you want?
I gave him what little money I had with me.
Your door was unlocked.
Do you have anything cheaper?
Both Tom and I like camping.
I'm important.
That was a very good try.
I'm sure it wasn't me who broke this.
The meeting will have finished by the time we get there.
He is painting a picture.
We came by to wish you luck.
The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself.
A coin dropped out of his pocket.
She put her elbows on her knees.
We are subject to the laws of nature.
Can cats really see in the dark?
He looks kind of pale.
Is all this money yours?
Does your dog bite?
What quantity of paper do you need?
That plane is enormous!
I couldn't put up with her arrogant behavior.
Everyone cheered.
Toyota's new car sports a hefty price tag.
I don't think that I could do that.
He's just like his grandfather.
I'd like to talk to you in my office.
Tom shouldn't spend so much.
When did you do this?
He shut the door.
An earthquake destroyed the building.
Time heals all wounds.
That small star is brightest.
Do they know that we know?
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
He lives far away from my house.
Am I wrong?
He was in prison on a charge of robbery.
Is the world more mad than usual this morning?
She weeded the garden.
You screwed up.
The man must be insane.
I had no other choice but to take him at his word.
Sit down and take it easy for a while.
I really should be going.
It's not anybody's fault.
You're smarter than me.
I'm available now.
I'm sure everything will take a turn for the better.
Tom was really crazy.
That doesn't interest us at all.
Flying a kite can be dangerous.
Let me ask you a few questions.
I can't agree with you on that point.
Are you out of your minds?
I made you coffee.
This is your fate.
That mountain is in the clouds.
The tree in front of the library was struck by lightning.
He's a construction worker.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
Don't eat too much.
I think I've seen that guy before.
I don't care who Tom is talking to.
I wanted to work this summer.
Can you jump that high?
Why don't you just start at the beginning?
I don't like both of them.
It was a tragic accident.
The baby doesn't walk yet.
We're separated.
We know what you're capable of.
My robot's name is Multi.
They couldn't help us.
This dog is a mongrel.
I'm so hungry.
I guess I don't understand what you're trying to say.
I'm sick and tired of hamburgers.
He teaches English.
I know you're on vacation.
They want to know what's going on.
He broke the window intentionally.
She's been having trouble with back pain for years.
I figured I might find you here.
I didn't catch what he said.
Thank you for calling me.
I met some hikers on the mountain.
How do I change my cell phone's ringtone?
Who's on your list?
Can you pick me up at the station?
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
Do you know what this is?
He can't drive.
I want to know what this is called.
Tom thinks you're lying.
I was beginning to worry about you.
I think we can manage.
I wonder if I should talk to her about the problem.
You don't have a choice.
I am doing my best.
The stars appeared.
I have some personal business to take care of.
Stop where you are.
It's better you don't know.
I just followed the recipe.
He is not altogether wrong.
I saw Tom a few minutes ago and he looked tired.
The dog chased the squirrel.
I really wish I could be there with you.
I saw many people who had no clothes and I saw many clothes which had no people in them.
Tom sold his car to Mary.
All of us plan to do that.
We want to do that now.
I am afraid things will take a turn for the worse.
Eat your vegetables.
I'd like you to take this.
I never stopped loving you.
How did you enjoy the movie?
I can't move.
Don't be cruel to animals.
I can't express my feelings.
Please turn off the radio.
A telephone is something you can't do without.
I really want to stay.
He believes that the story is true.
Could we have a table near the window?
Tom will take a look at it.
He has made up his mind to buy the car.
You're wasting your time trying to convince Tom.
Come on! Give me a chance.
What's the matter now?
Why don't we take some time to think about it?
Do you have laundry to do?
I think that it was Tom who did that.
He's a very nice boy.
They found no such proof.
Give me your phone.
The weather was miserable yesterday.
She is no beauty.
He went around the neighborhood collecting signatures.
My bicycle has a flat.
Tom bought a book.
Which browser are you using?
It's not every day you get a building named after you.
Is it happening?
Let's say that you're right.
I'm at your disposal.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
Ultraviolet rays are harmful to us.
I'm an agent.
I saved you.
She's my first love.
That is good to me.
Everything stopped.
I want to do some shopping around here.
Tom seems to need to go to the bathroom.
I should've told you everything earlier.
He ran through the streets naked.
I'm not supposed to help you.
Are you trying to manipulate me?
We all have fun.
My daughter studies in that school.
Tom is a lot older than us.
Have you ever had a serious illness?
He's under the chair.
It took me two hours to memorize this sentence.
Tom will die if he does that.
We went too far.
Who broke this?
I don't want to be alone with Tom.
Can you just go home?
That isn't French.
Why are you being mean to me?
Did you accomplish your goals?
She is no less beautiful than her sister is.
He was sleeping under the tree.
How many hours a day do you watch TV?
You have to obey the law.
That's not the point.
Is that a yes or no?
He tossed and turned all night.
Tom jumped.
Two weeks have passed and I haven't seen you.
I've just come up with a great idea.
Everyone is different.
Will that be all?
We're home.
I was just going to scare Tom.
He threatened to make it public.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary looks at him.
I didn't have time to watch TV yesterday.
I hate talking about politics.
It's not an either-or situation.
Would you care for some more cake?
What're you talking about?
The clock has stopped.
I haven't read both of his novels.
Our lives are determined by our environment.
Are you drinking green tea?
May I look at the menu?
I bet you're busy.
The wall was coated with paint.
They're going to have a look.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
I know him by name.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
I'd like to cooperate.
Tom teaches French.
I don't like that name.
I did it without you.
You have to come.
Tom was lying on the couch.
We talked.
We partied all night long.
He's a hopeless case.
You don't have to do that if you don't really want to.
She regrets having never been there.
He'll go to the hospital today.
I'm not doing that today.
He drew a straight line with his pencil.
How very curious!
Have you eaten lunch yet?
I've decided never to vote again.
I'm waiting for a phone call.
I've experienced the same thing.
Will you still be here this afternoon?
I've never had problems before.
Your proposal is worthy of being considered.
Why don't you come over and eat with us this evening?
Isn't that dishonest?
I didn't know that.
I considered not going.
My dog was sound asleep.
Can you see Tom?
Do you remember me?
Who would've thought it possible?
That's not cool.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm drinking water.
I'm not supposed to tell anyone about it.
Do you know how to do this?
I am too tired to keep on walking.
She advised him to stop working so much.
She's anxious to know the results.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I don't want to do that.
I find that difficult to believe.
I heard a noise.
What if someone sees us?
What time did you arrive there?
Tom doesn't know how to tie his shoes.
I hid myself behind a curtain.
I will bring it right away.
The room has been empty for a long time.
You're stuck.
Forget about her.
She married a sailor.
How did you get to know her?
Now I'm wide awake.
Wash your feet.
He was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
It's nice to see you.
Let me tell you a story.
Would you mind if I ate a piece of this pie?
You must be very proud.
She lost a book.
There's somebody at the door.
They are very big.
I saw him cross the road.
Tom always walks to school when it isn't raining.
Today is my treat.
It was a sunny day.
I wasn't expecting that to happen at all.
You'll be missed by your friends.
I was looking forward to this.
Wake up!
I'm disappointed in you.
Where's my razor?
That's something I never do after lunch.
The water's really nice.
I don't know why you're all so jumpy.
Would you like to talk to a lawyer?
I'd like to buy a wooden spoon.
Light is as necessary as water for plants.
We enjoy talking.
Don't stay up all night.
What scared you?
I'm not your son.
Give me your belt.
This was very interesting.
I think that they were all fired.
You could've said no.
Shouldn't you call the police?
I want to be left alone.
How did I look?
He is out of the office.
We have to do this the right way.
Taste it.
They cut down the tree.
I'm going to be sick.
She spends a lot of money when she goes abroad.
We'd better call the police.
I'm familiar with this neighborhood.
Prices depend on supply and demand.
It was a wise decision.
Tom deserves a better life.
Are you enjoying your weekend?
I don't know how they do it.
I don't even know how to dance.
Miyazaki is not what it used to be.
You may stay here if you want to.
I didn't expect so many people to be here.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
They didn't see anything.
You may now kiss the bride.
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll take the most expensive ones.
It's a shame we weren't able to get to know one another better.
I don't feel so well.
Do you have a bigger one?
He belittles others to make himself feel important.
Where does that road lead?
I'd like you to join us.
I love being a teacher.
I'm just curious.
The dragonfly was skimming across the water.
Those glasses suit you.
I want to get to know you.
Your approval is not required.
I want something to write on.
It never occurred to me that I might be fired.
Aren't you the one who's always saying we should spend more time together?
Correct the following sentences.
I don't want this shirt.
I expected that he would come.
I think that actress is one of the most beautiful women on earth.
I know you have it.
Do you feel like eating something?
Listen carefully to what I say.
Neither is true.
You're safe now.
I could scarcely believe it.
Are you falling for me?
Tom is worried about his children.
Stop following me.
Tom had no sons.
I don't think you're schizophrenic.
He stood up for what was right.
I had no choice.
All of us got three hundred dollars.
Tell Tom what you mean.
They went to the public swimming pool.
Do you think we should just wait and hope it changes?
Lunch is ready.
Don't smoke in this room.
It is necessary for you to stop smoking.
The bus is full. You'll have to wait for the next one.
I saw a dog.
Why do people go to the movies?
That's a lovely necklace.
You never have any money.
It's not like you think.
Do we have to get rid of that?
I know Tom is tough.
She will be a college student next spring.
It won't be long before we can start.
This pond has a lot of carp.
What would you like for breakfast?
Neither of my brothers will be there.
Are you close to your family?
I'm doing my duty.
Tom seldom eats seafood.
It's inspiring.
We can't give up now.
It's getting harder for me to concentrate.
Tom forgot to tell us not to drink the tap water.
I figured a change of scenery might do us good.
Tom comes from Boston.
I knew you'd like it.
Let's make a big circle.
Go kiss someone else.
This building belongs to my family.
I need support.
I come here every day.
Take the garbage out.
Are you ready to party?
We found her alive.
I really hope so.
I'd be grateful.
I'm popular.
Are you for real?
I'm getting more and more gray hair.
It's making me nostalgic.
These patients have trouble walking.
She was very rude to him.
Where are the forks?
I left something in the room.
Tom peeled the apple.
Grow up a little.
That was naive of me.
I think I can prove it.
It's so complicated.
I was the worst student in the class.
You know that's impossible.
It would be best if you didn't do that.
You're no help.
You're such a liar.
I never do any exercise.
You need to fix this.
I remember this place.
Which way are you going?
My grandfather has a dog.
She's making money hand over fist with the business she started.
She cried when she heard the story.
This is not true.
I was told to get enough sleep.
You're not welcome here.
I might stay.
I went to the post office.
Do you like French wines?
It's not getting worse.
A recent survey shows that the number of smokers is decreasing.
Let's see if someone can help us.
Will you join our club?
Some people compare life to a stage.
You have the advantage of a good education.
It's misleading.
I'm glad that's over.
I've always wanted to meet you.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't know Mary.
The whole world has gone crazy.
You are unbelievably naive.
I thought I heard you.
Zurich is considered to be a major financial hub.
It's difficult to make up for lost time.
I won't buy this product again.
I can't let you go.
What a lovely dress!
I'm attentive.
It was Saturday night.
Tom was absent from the meeting.
This box is made of paper.
I'm not convinced of that.
I don't know any of those people.
He is boiling with rage.
I can't find anything.
Why should I give you this?
Follow me and I will show you the way.
They are Christians.
They live on the floor beneath.
I'm on my way to visit a friend in the hospital.
Would you like a glass of orange juice with your breakfast?
The witch hunt has begun.
I left my key in my room.
Why don't you mind your own business?
A bunch of people told me not to eat there.
What were they doing here?
Call me when it's done.
Do you plan to stay long?
She has a few friends.
Do you have anything to do tonight?
Do it this way.
How soon are you going shopping?
She is constantly writing letters.
You should have been more careful.
Don't get me involved in this.
I only hope we're not too late.
I know you're still in love with me.
Excuse me. Can you speak English?
I think that fact is very important.
Stop talking about Tom.
English is studied all over the world.
I have no idea how I got here.
What did you expect?
You don't seem too sure.
Tom was disappointed in Mary's performance.
Tom is afraid of you.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
I've been doing it for years.
Stop crying like a little girl.
They're smiling.
The enemy is becoming more and more powerful.
The game has been postponed indefinitely.
The meeting is ten days away.
She's missed the boat.
That is the girl whose father is a doctor.
He always wants to have the last word.
He is not the sort of guy who gives in easily.
He has lots of new ideas.
You'll be in trouble.
I don't like traveling alone.
I was chosen to do that.
Try to avoid junk food.
It's kind of boring.
I just don't know what to do.
Things escalated quickly.
The teapot is whistling.
I will warn him.
Everyone gasps.
You think of everything.
I told you to leave it in the car.
He agreed to give us an interview.
She had a good time talking with him about his trip.
How much do you charge to fix a flat tire?
I hate all of them.
Tom likes the ocean.
There are no flowers growing on Mars.
I never thought of it that way.
It looks like we're running out of money.
Tom is likeable.
I want to write this down.
I know you're telling the truth.
Everything that Tom said is true.
He was looking at the sky.
Tom didn't really enjoy studying French.
I passed by four houses.
He predicted she would win.
Tom had to clean his room.
I forgot my glasses.
Tom loves playing the piano.
Stay in this room.
I don't know why you don't like Tom.
You're not fit.
The house was empty.
How do you explain it?
May I use your phone?
Is Tom well?
I think I've had one too many.
I was here when you came in.
Shut off the water.
Do you want this shirt?
I'm not going to change.
I think Tom is still in love with Mary.
There is a big hole in your stocking.
Can you take the lid off this box?
You're replaceable.
The first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan.
Did you understand what he said?
I do not like spring.
She advised him not to borrow money from his friends.
I'm smarter than you.
Tom looked at it suspiciously.
The train stopped because of the storm.
How could you think that?
I'll pay for this later.
I thought I was alone.
Is there central heating in this building?
Lie down on your left side.
Tom mistook me for my older brother.
Accidents happen all the time.
We went too far.
Thats what we heard.
Thank you for the present.
The train is always on time.
You're the only person I can trust.
He stuck to his promise.
Listening to music is a great way to relax.
This can't be what it looks like.
We should have taken the schedule into consideration.
She's two years older than him.
What's the real reason you're here?
I've been trying to get your attention.
You shouldn't take the things Tom says seriously.
The theory is not accepted yet.
It's been a long time since I've seen my family.
I'll be returning to Boston sometime next month.
Do you need the phone?
I remember meeting her somewhere.
I can swim well.
I had a nice chat with her.
He's three years older than me.
The meeting was almost over.
This isn't mine.
The soldiers could do nothing until spring.
Tom set the bird free.
You must not forget your schoolbooks.
Two heads are better than one.
I have nothing to do with the crime.
She slapped him in the face.
Hand me the remote.
His name is on the tip of my tongue.
I want to be useful.
We're successful.
This storm is not dangerous. You don't need to worry.
I'm not the only one who feels that way.
My school grades have been average.
They want to know what's happening.
Let's be frank.
Am I bothering you?
Loving is the essence of life.
He's sitting in the waiting room.
He has been living in the cabin by himself for more than ten years.
It's a work of art.
I've been here all night.
I will ask him about it tomorrow.
The job is half done.
I usually sleep with the lights on.
I have a secret I can't tell anyone.
That's exactly the point.
Tell the maid to make the beds.
My opinion doesn't really matter.
Have a snack.
Tom has been hammering all day.
What would I do without you?
I had some fun.
I have an errand I need to run.
I care about all of you.
I'm going on a business trip.
The whole world is watching.
She complained to him about the noise.
That nurse is very kind and polite.
I think I've found something of yours.
No one can keep me from going there.
Did you see anything you like?
I think you're creative.
Is he back already?
I borrowed the dictionary from my friend.
I want to go.
Have you finished writing that song you've been working on?
I would rather stay at home than go out.
We set up our tents before dark.
Tom is not religious.
The letters Tom wrote to Mary were returned unopened.
Tom needed to go home early.
That man stole all of his money.
It's a little complicated.
The new bridge is under construction.
What would you do if you had one year free?
The girl was afraid to jump down from the roof.
This flower is yellow and the others are blue.
She was pleased to see the results.
I left my address book in my room.
You're a wonderful woman.
I don't see how that is any of your business.
It was too difficult for me.
A French translation of this book was published in 2013.
You're a pig.
I can't help it.
I wasn't prepared for this.
I've made a decision.
I won't stand for it anymore.
The last part of the trip was across the desert.
Come with me.
We relaxed in the living room.
We felt the house shake.
Brush your teeth after every meal.
They hunted foxes.
I'm not interested in politics at all.
Were you hurt?
I did all the work.
I sold it for ten dollars.
This is one of mine.
I don't have a weapon.
My camera is different from yours.
It seems that I've lost my keys.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
I don't think we can really say that one is right and the other is wrong.
Tom and Mary began arguing.
You should be ready for the worst.
We've all been there.
Are you sure they can do this?
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Stop dating losers!
How did you do?
Give me a full glass of water.
I've lost my keys.
Thank you for calling.
It was a victory for the whole country when he finished first in the race.
He talks well.
I wonder who took it.
No one knew who did it.
Is this pencil yours?
I never forgot that.
They don't talk at all.
We're all aware of it now.
I realized I couldn't win.
The park is located in the center of the city.
The fire went out by itself.
Tom wouldn't let Mary keep it.
I don't really care about that.
I left my hat on the plane.
Tom won't be in time for the meeting.
I don't believe anything those people say.
Tom hurt himself.
I like big cities.
I got what you wanted.
I have to go upstairs.
One of my friends bought a red car.
What time did your friend go home?
You have to give up sports for a while.
I feel faint.
She took advantage of our hospitality and stayed a whole month without paying us anything.
I began driving our tractor when I was 12 years old to help my father out at harvest time.
They're all terrified.
I have a dog.
Do you sell jewelry?
Tom wants to be rich.
I need more power.
Are you afraid of something?
It's a beautiful day!
He went to America last week.
My mother goes to the market every day to buy things.
You seem to know all the answers.
The knife isn't sharp.
That's not very reassuring.
That was the best meal I've ever eaten.
I don't know how to drive.
He earns his living by teaching English.
I'm not sure of the exact date.
They say that old house is haunted.
You are watching TV all the time.
She cannot stop us.
I know that I'm good enough.
I hate women who say that all men are the same.
I love you with all my heart.
I had to get out of there.
What's in the bottle?
You were right after all.
I wasn't aware that you were so ill.
What a beautiful garden!
Germany borders on France.
The old couple sat side by side.
Tom put his ear to the door in an effort to overhear what Mary was saying on the phone.
Cheese is easy to cut with a knife.
I want you to stay on the beach.
I'm not a singer.
He's a bit tipsy.
Do you really think you can do this?
I'm taller than you.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
I've drifted apart from my friends.
Do you want me to bring my guitar?
He let me stay for a night.
Do you want to take that risk?
Stop screaming.
What does this hat remind you of?
The floorboards creak a bit when you walk across them.
Tom didn't know he was supposed to do that today.
You have a very nice family.
He's a smart little feller.
I like music.
I may need to move on.
It was working.
Have you ever dyed your hair?
Tell us what happened last night.
Bring that here.
I don't have my glasses with me.
I know that Tom is a specialist.
We have an advantage.
I did that late last night.
Is there a rule that says I can't do this?
Do you trust me?
You're obnoxious.
I just wanted to be sure.
Maybe we should tell somebody.
My friend is beside me.
Who's taking responsibility for the loss?
She says that she is happy.
School starts at 8:40.
I don't expect help.
I hadn't planned to tell you anything about this.
When did you buy it?
Tom knew what Mary wanted to eat.
I'll tell Tom you called.
I'd rather not try.
They're crazy.
We are faced with a host of problems.
I've given you everything I had.
Did anyone miss me?
My father is two years younger than my mother.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
You're not supposed to be smoking in here.
She told him where to put the suitcase.
Let's come back here someday.
She cut her hand with a knife.
He stayed out of public life.
How many teeth does a cow have?
Better late than never.
The accent of this word is on the second syllable.
A few minutes' walk brought me to the shore.
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
How do you know what I had?
That is new a shop which opened last week.
We'll never let you down.
We both do that.
What are you playing with?
I appreciate what you did today.
Why don't you use a hammer?
I dropped my earring.
Don't come again.
I prefer to do it by myself.
Preheat the oven to 130 degrees.
We got up at dawn.
Can you believe it? She's even lazier than me.
Did you just hit Tom?
Tom has been giving Mary good advice.
I believe the answer is yes.
I'm surprised it was that easy.
I overslept so I was late to school.
What have you come here for?
Where did you get that scar?
I was jealous of my brother.
That's a huge relief.
I see the problem.
I'm glad to be home.
They were talking about you.
They had lost the Civil War.
Cut that out!
You always tell me to think for myself.
I think you went too far.
We only have one television.
What's your blood type?
I enjoyed the voyage across the Pacific.
Get out of my house.
He seems to think so.
I love poetry.
Tom should've been an actor.
I could see nothing but fog.
I haven't yet met Tom's parents.
I don't actually work here.
I have not had anything to eat since this morning.
You're the only one for me now.
A fallen leaf floated on the surface of the water.
Solar energy is a new source of energy.
My dad died when I was thirteen.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
The red hat goes well with her dress.
I think you'd better leave.
Tom taught me how to play chess.
He is sensitive to criticism.
Most shops near the school are closed on Saturdays now.
Tom rinsed off the plates and put them into the dishwasher.
They're here.
There are many beautiful parks in London.
I want to be very clear about that.
I think it's unlikely that aliens similar to what we see in the movies have ever visited our planet.
I'm at the airport now.
There are no loopholes.
What the devil are you doing?
Tom doesn't want to live in Boston.
You may sit down on the chair.
I can confirm that.
I never worried about Tom.
That was my goal.
You're adorable.
That kiss was amazing.
I want you out of here right now.
I'm looking for my dog.
We can open the windows.
I hope everyone is happy.
Take this medicine when you have a cold.
Tom is a financial analyst.
He is madly in love with that girl.
I'm fed up with him always preaching to me.
His proposal is completely out of the question.
I felt rather puzzled.
You have overstepped your authority.
I'm very pleased to hear the news.
The baby seemed to be fast asleep.
They can't all be full.
He lost his life in an accident.
He pretended to be ignorant.
You're being watched.
All you have to do is ask him to pay the debt.
I want to thank everyone who helped me do this.
That's a really good painting.
Have you ever been in love?
He has visited Europe several times.
I don't care for flowers very much.
Tom died in prison ten years ago.
You've risked enough.
I brought you another blanket.
How about we go for a drink?
He used to love her.
My mother is the first one to get up every morning.
It's just not safe.
The teacher has given Tom permission to do whatever he wants.
I was ready.
I'm usually pretty patient.
I'm too tired to help.
He is not Japanese.
Did Tom listen to you?
I don't know if this is true.
How can you make your way in life without a good education?
Seriously?
I live upstate.
You can see many animals in this forest.
When did it end?
A bow is no use without arrows.
Are you interested in me?
We don't have any milk.
How in the world did you find me?
I don't know why you're all so jumpy.
I'm letting you go.
I wish that I could have spent more time with my father before he died.
The mayor denied having taken a bribe.
I'll buy you a beer.
Was there much damage?
We were in Boston.
He's an old timer.
I'm going to need help.
What do you spend a majority of your time doing?
They won't let Tom escape.
How did you get here so fast?
I didn't see him again after that.
I hope your wish will come true.
Are you going there on business?
The girls won.
It must be hard to do that.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
I'm not going to show you this.
Do you want us to take you home with us?
That's my dog.
That boy showed no fear.
I would like to rent a car.
We're both writers.
This dog is trained to smell out drugs.
I thought you were mad at me.
This is my father's.
You smell awful.
Tom hasn't eaten anything today.
I'm not as happy now.
What a country!
She was busy doing her homework.
We can't just act as if nothing has happened.
Tom began fixing dinner.
Botany is the scientific study of plants.
You're not wanted here.
I am accustomed to working hard.
They're mad at you.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Don't make the same mistake I did.
He thought that it would be interesting and fun.
Christmas is only a few days away.
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him.
Go back to the lab.
I can't agree with you on that point.
I felt winded after running up the stairs.
I can help you out.
I can't believe he kissed you.
We'll leave at dawn.
I'm starved.
She lived with him all her life.
I owe him some money.
The early bird catches the worm.
I'm here every night.
I didn't get an email from Tom today.
How about going to see a movie tonight?
Nobody answered the phone.
We just wanted you to know.
Have we ever met before?
I can't believe you would allow this.
Thank you for stopping by.
It is to be expected.
Tom has a healthy life style.
Is everything ready?
He's coming.
She does not like him.
Tom turned off the air conditioner.
I hate to eat alone.
I want to eat a steak.
Don't worry about that now.
Excuse me. Can you direct me to the nearest subway station?
You might not want to mention that.
Please don't use my name.
She is kind.
I wonder if this milk is still good.
Can I eat this?
You had better put on your crash helmet.
Tom is headed towards Boston.
I simply don't understand.
Aren't you glad you're rich?
You're doing the right thing.
She has the same bag as you have.
How long are they?
I cannot do without this dictionary.
I'm just tired.
Do you have a boyfriend?
She's not invited to parties.
Tom and Mary left the party together.
This doesn't look good at all.
Mary was wearing a navy blue skirt.
Wait a little longer.
I hesitated about which road to take.
It's impossible to anticipate every possible situation.
This room is not very large.
That dog tries to eat just about anything he lays his eyes on.
The scars are barely visible.
Japan is in eastern Asia.
I had a lovely night.
I know exactly what to do.
It is no use arguing with such a foolish man.
I'm going home now.
We could see the lights of the town in the distance.
Nobody wants it.
Tom didn't say what you said he said.
Such a thing has never happened before.
Are you suggesting it's a design flaw?
Stop changing the subject.
We're leaving tomorrow.
She was accepted by Harvard.
Come into the room.
Tom seems young.
Tom is exactly three weeks old.
I don't know if I should tell him.
I let the cat out of the house.
All you have to do is to make a comment.
Tom waited more than an hour.
I want you to be safe.
This seems risky.
Do you have a cellphone?
Everybody likes you.
I thought you hated me.
Tom knows Mary's dog's name.
I thought it might be you.
I wonder if Tom is still lonely.
The concert was awful.
I had a quick breakfast.
The server is down.
I stayed at a cheap hotel.
The rule only applies to foreigners.
It's awfully cold this evening.
Your father got a promotion.
She said she had been happy.
Green doesn't go with red.
I need to write a book report.
I'll meet you down at the station tomorrow.
We're not going to lie to you.
Mary isn't like other girls.
Are you lonely?
His child's life is in danger.
It's on the sofa.
I don't want any more problems.
He will play baseball tomorrow.
I found him a job.
It's a very stressful job.
Who stole the apple?
He came out on top.
I know I'll have to be punished.
She doesn't listen to him.
The boys played in the mud.
I've known Tom for quite some time.
Is there something you want to say?
We're not on a date.
He cut down a tree in the garden.
I appreciate the sentiment.
Tom is a well-known singer.
I quickly ate lunch.
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
They're lucky to be alive.
Everyone fell asleep.
My brother gave me a pair of jeans.
You're very upset.
How much did you get out of the deal?
I want you to tell me why you did that.
Is it to go?
I saw him enter the room.
You don't seem tired at all.
You look nervous.
I want to leave this place quickly.
We loaded our baggage into the car.
I live with my parents.
I have a plan.
Your ideas are quite old fashioned.
How's everybody?
A lot still remains to be done.
It seems quiet enough.
The patient requires constant care.
I thought you'd be happy.
Don't be sorry.
Tom has been very respectful.
It looks like you were wrong.
We need money.
I never wanted to be an actor.
He speaks Russian.
A poor rice harvest will get us into real trouble.
You need to focus on your strengths.
The concert was a success.
I need to hear it.
Tom speaks several languages.
The road turns left there.
He got injured in a traffic accident.
This song reminds me of my junior high school days.
I'm always at home.
I thought I knew all your secrets.
What's the commotion?
The talks will last three days.
I'm a minister.
I'm ashamed.
I don't want to go if you don't go with me.
We're almost there.
You've suffered enough.
I was shaken.
He was checking you out.
He still hasn't responded.
You seem to be an honest man.
I have standards.
You're totally ignorant.
You can't prove a thing.
You seem to hate women.
He has to study hard.
I don't like that name.
Does she play the piano?
I've lived here my entire life.
Do you get it?
Tom's name was on the box.
Cut it in half.
Would you mind rubbing my feet?
Today is a holiday.
Can you remember the first word you learned in English?
She will be happy when she gets married.
I like playing with my dog.
Do you like coffee?
I suppose you won't mind if I take one.
We really shouldn't have done that.
Don't let opportunities pass by.
Stay calm and do your best.
She looked him right in the eye.
Guess what I'm holding in my hand.
He didn't reply to my letter.
You're seriously ill.
I think Tom's idea is a good one.
The professor treated her as one of his students.
I think it's time for me to go.
Are you sleepy?
The nurse attended the patient.
He tried it with a friend.
I've decided to learn shorthand.
I would like to be an English teacher.
Why are you all here?
Are they brothers?
We have nothing to hide.
Is the job too much for you?
This is the best season for hiking.
You should have been more careful.
It was a great trip.
I figured I'd find you here.
Don't judge a man by the way he looks.
Can Tom speak French?
There's been a lot of activity around the office this morning.
She's had a hard life.
You have caused me to lose my temper.
That could be anything.
It was a relief.
The middle one is mine.
I hope you had a good time at the party.
You should ask your parents for permission.
The meeting was held here.
Tom unfolded his napkin.
He no longer works here.
You've left me no choice.
Prices will continue to go up.
I hate being photographed.
Just stay away from my daughter.
Termites eat wood.
I remember seeing him once.
The paper wasn't important.
I learned a lot.
No one really cares.
I need a cab.
He made a mistake.
It's being arranged.
It's time for bed.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
May I have your name and address?
We spent hours looking for it.
Tom is from Boston.
Tom isn't like me.
I learned that in the first year of medical school.
Perhaps you can beat me.
I'll never forget this incident.
Be kind to little animals.
Where were you yesterday at 2:30?
There is very little probability of an agreement being reached.
I wasn't serious.
Would you really do that?
She is the editor-in-chief.
She refused his offer.
We never talked about that again.
Did I hear you talking to someone?
Three of the men involved in the accident were hospitalized.
Am I talking too fast?
That one usually works.
She's very interested in music.
That's not what you want to do.
I'd like to buy a washing machine.
Tom still doesn't believe it.
I checked Tom's computer.
I don't know where he is or what he's doing.
I'd like to work at a hospital.
Don't approach the dog.
Nobody told us anything.
Is that supposed to be a question?
I'm rational.
I'll be with you as soon as I finish this job.
Don't die.
Let's say no more about it.
She needed some money to buy something to feed her dog.
You are blinded by love.
I just felt a little dizzy. That's all.
Tom asked Mary to lend him some money.
They asserted that it was true.
Can you juggle?
I think you need a lawyer.
I'd like you to sing a song for me.
I see what you mean.
The section chief seems to like abusing his authority.
The old man in front of us is ninety-two years old.
I want to marry her.
He flew a kite with his son.
We can't open this yet.
You should spend a little time each day reviewing vocabulary.
Their rooms are always clean.
He is going to be a doctor when he grows up.
He just doesn't measure up.
Can you stay for a while?
Do you think Tom knows what happened?
The plane left after a three-hour delay.
I know you know this.
Somebody has to be held accountable for his death.
We're all going home.
This is outrageous.
Tell me where you went.
This hat is too small for me.
He always studies hard.
You're overworked.
They gave me no choice.
I wish you all good luck.
I'm using that cup.
The balcony juts out over the street.
I never made such a promise.
Tom and Mary are exhausted.
I never thought I'd say that.
His sister can't talk to you today.
Why not live it up?
I decided not to go to Europe.
They rushed towards their mother.
That's what we're working on.
Look up the new words in your dictionary.
I'm full.
You tried.
You have nothing to be afraid of.
She used to enjoy being with him.
Be kind to others.
I'm a little tired today.
I plan to go skiing with my girlfriend.
You'll feel better now.
I'm wondering what I should do next.
He had led the Republican Party with great success.
The man who is constantly making decisions and being compelled to alter them gets nowhere.
Is that only a coincidence?
How did you get here so fast?
That's odd.
I think he'll never return.
Can I get you anything?
I wouldn't sell that at any price.
Have you ever driven a sports car?
Are you telling us the truth?
I was shaken.
All our plans went wrong.
Tom didn't know anything about Mary's past.
Lychees taste of grapes.
Did I say too much?
Stay awake.
I already have a bus ticket.
We are at war.
We're under attack.
Isn't that exciting?
We're all scared.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
It was flat.
Tom ate three pieces of cake.
He tied the dog to a tree.
What's in the file?
Let's go this way.
That's happening far too often.
I will make every effort to get it.
What Tom said made a lot of sense.
He makes it a rule to take a walk every morning.
Tom promised me he'd come.
I really have nothing else to say.
What you were taught is wrong.
We'll be home all day tomorrow.
I need to go shopping.
I gave you what you wanted.
It's booby-trapped.
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
Everyone started talking at once.
I had the feeling you were going to ask me that.
My brother gave me a cute doll.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
We could meet downtown. Would that be convenient for you?
I've never lived in Australia.
I should've gone home.
I'm sorry to call you so late at night.
I get the feeling that no one here is telling us the truth.
There were about one thousand people.
Why was Tom killed?
Someone has stolen our clothes.
Nobody's allowed to do that.
We invited him to our house.
He's interested in Mayan prophecies.
Taste this wine to see if you like it.
Would you mind speaking more slowly?
That's not good enough for you.
He can't tell what is written on the paper.
This job is beyond my ability.
Take a look at this report.
A gigantic bird came flying toward him.
Read Lesson 10 from the beginning.
I have some cash stashed away.
The dove is a symbol of peace.
Online banking is very convenient.
I chickened out.
It's all I need.
I was playing a game when I felt an earthquake.
His parents love me.
It has always been a pleasure to work with you.
Let's get cracking!
Tom was really crazy.
He is very learned.
Do you like his songs?
It's the least I could do.
Don't talk to me about work.
I can't remember all their names.
I'll leave it up to you.
Can I buy only the lenses?
Am I really the only one here who doesn't understand French?
This is a very good tea.
He took out his handkerchief.
Tom's birthday was yesterday.
Clean it up.
The tree's root system stretches over thirty meters.
My father stopped drinking.
Tom said he wanted to talk.
Has he gone already?
Make a circle and hold hands.
Tom drives slowly.
Where did you put my keys?
I don't need your job.
I respect those who always do their best.
It's not worth reading any further.
Why do you like horses?
My daughter is looking forward to Christmas.
I almost always win.
The world is dangerous.
A friend told me that story.
He's not at home.
My brother is a freshman.
My left arm is asleep.
None of us have eaten yet.
I know you think there's no hope.
I just want to get some sleep.
Tom wants to see you.
I missed you last night.
Are you going on foot or by bus?
I can't stand these people.
Life could be so easy.
We won.
You should give up drinking and smoking.
What did you get?
Why didn't you listen to your father?
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
I don't care if you go or not. I'm going anyway.
Tom bought three umbrellas.
They planned their first vacation.
I had to see you again.
No one will see us.
She took advantage of the fine weather to paint the wall.
I've got a lot of good friends.
Could you find a room for my sister?
Almost all of my neighbors are nice.
You may as well tell me the truth.
The Greeks used to worship several gods.
Tom often walks to school.
Don't tell me who I like.
How many times a week do you take a bath?
Everyone ought to be the master of his own destiny.
How come you know so much about Japanese history?
He will be coming to the party.
Be kind to old people.
How long have you been in this town?
I drank beer out of a plastic cup.
We'll win.
Do you want to make a deal?
I can't eat all of this.
Tom talked with Mary yesterday.
Do you know his birthplace?
I'm asking you as a friend.
Go back to your seats.
The cat crossed the street.
Do you like this leather jacket?
There are holes in the roof.
Can you recommend a good dictionary to me?
Tom and Mary sang in the choir together.
You worry about your weight too much.
Everyone wants to be young and attractive.
Open your mouth!
We ate sandwiches for lunch.
The police can't arrest you.
Is French pronunciation difficult?
I'm more than happy.
I think it's dangerous for children to swim in this lake.
I made reservations.
Do you have any others?
Let's try this.
I'll attend the meeting.
I'd be happy to work with you.
What did you expect?
What're we looking for?
You must be very proud of your son.
I want to stay here as long as I can.
Have a good time.
I've never met a musician that I didn't like.
I'll sing.
This bicycle belongs to me.
Buy me a drink.
I have nothing to be worried about.
Who's your oldest friend?
What'll you do back in Australia?
I'll do anything.
The girls won.
I hope to soon know much more than a few sentences in Dutch.
This doctor is a man of culture.
I bought that record in this store.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
What exactly have you got in mind?
You can get from Washington to New York by train.
This old building isn't worth fixing up. It would be better to tear it down.
You should spend a little time each day reviewing vocabulary.
I hope we didn't wake you.
My mouth is numb.
Where do you want to live after you retire?
She told me her secret.
That's my cat.
She is what we call a bookworm.
I'm the youngest one here.
We will soon be having snow.
There was no need to talk.
Let's review Lesson 5.
Someone might get hurt.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
I stayed with a friend of mine.
There's something I have to do.
I wonder what's wrong with the car.
What do you eat on Christmas Day?
Most people only want to hear their own truth.
Is that what you want to do?
Faded jeans are still in fashion.
I was detained.
We have a party this evening.
Tom is leaving at 2:30 this afternoon.
I didn't feel like eating lunch.
They demanded that the mayor should resign.
I don't know what you really want.
We arrived first.
I think all three of us will be there tomorrow.
I'll do everything that I can.
I know you want to help.
Everyone wanted to talk to Tom.
I think Tom didn't understand you.
It wasn't very fun.
That never should've happened.
She has nothing in common with him.
I live near here.
Who's had enough?
Get a hold of yourself.
He hung up.
I'm on duty.
If only it would stop raining!
I'm happy to be back.
I try to keep a low profile.
I don't have anything new.
I can't give you that much money.
It's sand.
The door was wide open.
She used to pray before going to bed.
I'm leaving it to you.
I glanced through the brochure.
No one ever knew the true story except the three of us.
I suppose I'd better be more careful the next time.
I want to make friends with your sister.
They'll let us know.
What a bad movie!
I thought I heard you.
What do you expect us to do?
He often falls in love.
It is getting warmer day by day.
I need a volunteer.
They love their children.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle.
Did I make the team?
Hang on!
The early bird gets the worm.
You will always be there.
We have no reason to change our plans.
It must be done more carefully.
I plead guilty.
Stay away from my motorcycle.
The station is three kilometers away from here.
He has never been scolded by his father.
Are you sure about this?
Tell me why you did it.
Everything is all right at home.
There's a place for us.
I'm sure I don't need to do that.
I persuaded him to give up the idea.
I was just wondering if you have any experiences you would like to share with us.
"Who is it? ""It's your mother."""
We've been up all night.
I lost sight of her in the crowd.
You're not alone.
It was probably not true.
Each student has his own desk.
She put up with the pain quite well.
We didn't stay in Boston.
That's exactly what I said.
We know very little about the cause of this disease.
She wants a serious relationship.
I had a busy afternoon.
I don't think this armchair is comfortable.
She suggested that the customer buy a blue tie.
The hostages will be released.
Have you seen Tom recently?
That needs to be corrected.
Her blue shoes go well with that dress.
How deep is this well?
She is well known both in Japan and in America.
The footprints continued down to the river.
I want you to help me clean it up.
This is all a misunderstanding.
It was too soft.
It was kind of you to help me.
You said you were happy.
I had the brakes of my bicycle adjusted.
The baby is able to walk.
I'm not advocating that.
Tom and Mary have just gotten back to Boston.
Tom says he'll never do that.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Step forward and make room for others.
Never go to a doctor whose office plants have died.
I want to say I'm sorry.
Who told you the story?
I want to do something useful.
I want you to take charge of this operation.
I don't know whether I'll be able to attend tomorrow's meeting.
I often go there to meditate.
Be nicer to your sister.
I appreciate that very much.
I think that you should watch that movie.
Can't you speak French?
Everybody was staring at me.
He complained to her about the food.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
My father is a good speaker of English.
You can do that tomorrow.
Why does everyone think that I'm stupid?
Marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Why's everybody so quiet?
That was the goal.
What'll we do if Tom is late?
Do you still believe I killed my brother?
Why are you lying?
He is complaining about something or other all the time.
That's not what we want.
Do you want to come with us?
I don't think you did this by yourself.
Are you sure we've never met before?
The chances are slim to none that you'll win the lottery.
I finished reading the book last night.
I really want you to quit.
She smiled at him uneasily.
Get your gear.
Don't let that dog come near me!
I don't like anything here.
That's exactly what I want to hear.
I'm sure Tom is suffering.
We're not moving.
Every person is unique.
Did you have fun last night?
I'm not doing it anymore.
I could sure use that reward money.
I don't really understand what just happened.
I'm sure things will work out.
My high school French teacher wasn't a native speaker.
Everyone escaped.
We've finished.
I didn't mean that literally.
Why don't you put on some clothes?
What do you do when you're not at work?
I'm very interested in learning French.
You can eat whatever you like.
Are you paying together or separately?
Are you mentally ill?
I'll talk to him at the earliest possible moment.
Did anybody see you?
You're flattering me.
I dislike living in such a noisy place.
We're in a recession.
They did not listen.
Have you met her?
His ambition knows no bounds.
I've got a big day tomorrow.
I make it a rule never to borrow money.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
Here's my business card.
Do you carry weapons?
We are expecting the publication of his book.
It's essential that we find them.
Everybody wants permanent peace.
You aren't likely to find that word in a dictionary that's this small.
He met an unexpected obstacle.
I'd like to discuss something with you.
She is always dressed in black.
I don't have any objection to that.
I can't believe I'm telling you this.
She always buys expensive clothes.
There'll come a day when you'll regret it.
They were sunbathing on the beach.
I'm writing a song.
I used to play the guitar fairly well.
I can't find Tom anywhere.
It's my CD.
Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
How much are these potatoes?
Tom is being held prisoner.
You look a little shaken.
The architect achieved worldwide fame.
A butterfly is a mature caterpillar.
This city is hard to live in.
I can't go to the cops.
I don't know why you did it.
I learned it in school.
She is a reliable person.
I think that a lot of people will be there today.
Why are you alone?
Did I give you enough time?
It's very expensive.
That can't be Mary. She's in the hospital now.
Tom seemed genuinely surprised when I told him that Mary had left town.
I must hurry.
You are not supposed to smoke here.
Are you leaving now?
No one can tell.
What do you feel most proud of?
Can I borrow your pen for a few minutes?
I don't care what you think.
The street is empty.
That could be difficult.
Marriage frightens some people.
My English teacher recommended that I read these books.
He hit me by mistake.
Do you think I should go alone?
It's easy to see why.
She agreed with him on what to do with the old car.
Doesn't that car look familiar?
I couldn't take that chance.
I'm really hungry.
Tom told us to be quiet.
You're very upset.
I love golf.
I remember everything you tell me.
This bicycle belongs to me.
I think you should do it.
Are you going to do that anytime soon?
Prices have jumped.
Tom lost control of the car.
He's not in our group.
Am I being accused of murder?
Ask me tomorrow.
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
She avoided him whenever possible.
Did I give you enough time?
Can the baby walk?
I love what you've done to this place.
Why do you ignore me?
Tom forgot to salute.
It's not always cold in Boston.
It could take a few weeks.
I just wanted to help Tom.
Tom doesn't seem to like me.
What do you think you'll do with your life?
Beware of jellyfish.
I left some stuff I need in the car.
We will only consent on that condition.
I don't think it's safe to go out at night by yourself.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
Tom wasn't in his room this morning.
I am a good boy.
Many small companies went bankrupt.
A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide pollution that we produce as a result of our activities. Some people try to reduce their carbon footprint because they are concerned about climate change.
He's an accredited representative of the Canadian government.
I'll take you back to school.
I just want to be a good neighbor.
Tom knows a lot of people.
Everybody hates you.
Tom's scared.
You've been selected.
They seem surprised.
Tom says he doesn't know much about Boston.
I never really knew Tom.
I don't want you to be hurt.
You're fortunate.
I've done that already.
Time is running out.
I found my mother busy ironing out some shirts.
This book was very interesting.
This box contains apples.
I tried it.
Thoughts are expressed by means of words.
I couldn't have done that if you hadn't been helping me.
I'm no match for you.
Tom and Mary are both professors.
The ceremony was impressive.
I want to run.
We need to cut costs.
I didn't have anything to drink.
We're just getting ready to eat.
I thought you were serious.
I'm looking for an old man.
I can't go back to prison.
He silently went out of the room.
Tom told them not to do that.
To try to bring it back would be foolish.
He got lost while walking in the woods.
Trim the fat off the meat.
They sell that at a hardware store.
Let's go outside for some fresh air.
Why aren't you studying?
My family will be away for a week.
How many close friends do you have?
I saw you there.
Tom has a big mouth.
It's pretty light.
They settled in the country.
Do you mind opening the door?
Don't tell me you can't read.
Let me carry your suitcase for you.
Show me your passport.
Check again.
Tom isn't a good musician.
Should we continue?
We bought a house.
Where should we pitch the tent?
Tom asked Mary if she would be willing to donate some money.
All of these meetings are in English.
I didn't know what to say to him.
I thought we had an understanding.
Which of these rackets is yours?
I play video games.
My son is too skinny.
He wants to go to America.
I don't remember anything.
I did the right thing.
She works as hard as anybody does.
I'm not telling you again.
I've tried that already.
He was very kind to them.
You can spend the night at our place.
You should be ashamed of your conduct.
Do you like San Francisco?
Try not to get wet.
The plane has hit several air pockets.
Let's find Tom before Mary does.
I made a bad mistake.
That didn't help.
Are both of you still single?
They were so frightened that they couldn't move an inch.
Tom and Mary are older than John.
I don't condone murder.
We charge a commission of 3%.
Tom and Mary finally decided to get divorced.
Let's hope that's enough time.
He has been playing tennis since this morning.
I did have fun.
We saw smoke in the distance.
I spent two hours playing the piano.
He was fed up with life in the city.
Do it the way I told you to.
He encountered unexpected obstacles.
The kids will be happy to see you.
You don't need luck.
I didn't sign up for this.
He knows almost nothing about that animal.
That is where you are wrong.
He will come back to Japan in the middle of May.
Are you in a hurry?
The stated price does not include labor charges.
She's too loud.
No other student in the class is as brilliant as he is.
They were murdered.
Your smile always makes me happy.
You can probably buy one of these cheaper elsewhere.
Do you need a ride?
Do you really think that your plan is realistic?
Everyone started laughing.
I asked the butcher to trim all the fat off of the meat.
I want to see more.
She is particular about her dress.
It's a pleasure to see you again.
Who else do you want on your team?
I'll be in my office from ten tomorrow.
The outcome of the upcoming election will be the hardest ever to predict.
Her success as a singer made her famous.
I wish we could ask Tom that question.
I think it's dangerous.
Why don't we just reformat the hard disk? You've been having a lot of trouble with it.
Will the train leave on time?
What'll you eat?
It cost me a fortune to get my car repaired.
Life isn't easy.
Let's take a look.
It's confidential.
What is the main purpose of your studying English?
I'd better see what's going on.
We're done answering questions.
Why haven't you eaten the food that I cooked?
I went there today.
She started dancing when she was eight.
I enjoyed your company.
I have to go to the hospital.
I go for a walk every morning.
She didn't want him to play poker.
Is that why you're upset?
I like French.
Even monkeys fall from trees.
How many aunts and uncles do you have?
It was all there.
I was a high school student at that time.
I'll get you some brandy.
I'm listening.
Your French is getting better.
I broke up with him.
Have you made up your mind?
What are you doing on Monday?
I'll be careful never to be late again.
Rinse with warm water.
Your eccentricities can make you either charming or tedious.
She gave me a watch for a birthday present.
How did you kill the cockroach?
We're unprejudiced.
How is that different?
I couldn't let Tom go without saying goodbye.
I don't know why I said that.
There's no telling when she'll stab you in the back.
Don't tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend.
They have to be very careful.
It's your book.
Let's start with this bottle of wine.
I just don't want to overdo it.
We grew closer every day.
Can you believe this is really happening?
She looked at him angrily.
It's something new.
Tom crossed the room.
I feel like a new man.
You didn't need to hurry. You got here too early anyway.
It was working.
The whole school agreed to the proposal.
Tom is getting old.
The medicine didn't do me any good.
Do you know when Tom will get back?
It works pretty well here.
Here is my phone number.
The university administration lowered tuition.
Are your parents with you?
Where's the rest of my money?
Anybody can participate.
I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake.
We are two of a kind.
I'm not bluffing.
Do you remember anything from back then?
The students seem bored.
I feel bad for them.
She revealed the secret to him.
I'm not in the mood to go downtown.
I already know how to dance.
You can hear the news on the radio at nine o'clock.
Did you tell Tom what he needed to know?
Tom only mentioned Mary twice.
I thought I'd find you here.
We know what we have to do.
I thought I had a day off.
You've turned up at the right moment.
Are you sure you don't want something to eat?
She's not as tall as him.
This is the house where that poet lived when he was a child.
There are books here.
He is the boss's private secretary.
You'll need this.
She writes beautifully.
She advised him to read more books.
That's what we're aiming for.
I saw him just now.
Monday will probably be a rainy day.
Tom has become a father.
It turned out to be true.
Everyone is staring at Tom.
What do you love? What do you hate?
How long will that be?
Can you do a headstand?
This is a very scary place.
He never cared much for me.
I don't like long drives.
We don't have any money.
Sit down and shut up.
Anyone can do it as long as they try.
Why did you want to come back here?
The bus is capable of carrying thirty people.
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry?
I wonder if you could help us.
He is much smarter than I am.
I'm trying to make a good first impression.
I don't have to be here.
I'm sure you have other skills.
The government made no move to solve the housing problem.
Write carefully and legibly.
We are happy to have you join our team.
I deserved that.
I've got a wife at home.
I feel like I'm not wanted.
I'll be back before you know it.
It's dangerous for a beginner to swim here.
Everyone needs a place to call home.
We are doctors.
Tom isn't sure he's ready to perform on stage.
It was effective.
What's the weather like?
The rumor spread all over the town.
I only found out a couple days ago.
I remember saying that.
I don't believe you just said that.
You look busy.
Those three are his daughters.
He's started writing a novel.
He didn't get paid for it.
That's really funny.
Would you be happier if I stayed?
They were all busy.
Did you hear it too?
What's going on tonight?
I didn't know whether I wanted to go to university.
She's very emotional.
He mentioned it.
I'm drowning.
I had no idea what I should write.
Is someone meeting us?
You'd better go. It's getting late.
She painted the walls white.
Don't do that. You're making Tom cry.
This is Tom's knife.
My boss is twice as old as I am.
I was here all day yesterday.
I did that very carefully.
I was feeling nostalgic.
It's merely a joke.
Mary left Tom for another man.
I spoke with my family.
I have no comment yet.
I think I can do better.
Why are they doing this?
I don't even know why.
Tom wasn't allowed to leave.
Get your mother to do your homework!
We'll put you on the list.
I'll check with you later.
The snowstorm raged for a full week.
That's why he got up early.
Why aren't you talking to me?
This movie is suitable for children.
He managed to escape through a window.
They brush their teeth twice a day.
We're both insane.
I think it's time to leave.
Play that song again.
I wonder why eggs are sold by the dozen.
I just don't want to discuss it right now.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I didn't say I was completely satisfied.
It used to be nearly impossible to do this.
What time do you start check-in?
Does this look good on me?
Don't worry. I'm a doctor.
That'll buy us a little time.
They finished their meal.
You gotta get more organized.
I have hardly any money left.
It was nice and cool there.
I think you're right.
Would you like to go fishing next weekend?
I never drink beer before lunch.
I've brought you a gift.
How about ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert?
I think my girlfriend is kind of cute.
Sitting down all day and looking at a computer screen is bad for you.
I would like some envelopes.
I haven't seen you for a while.
Evening was drawing near.
We made a good team.
The students snickered.
I totally understand.
You'd better think twice beforeagreeing to do that.
I want to buy a new camera.
Did you read all the fine print?
He will pay for everything.
I like you.
I doubt that our new boss will be any worse than the old one.
Can you believe this is really happening?
We went to church.
Tom shook my hand.
I almost kissed him.
Did you tell Tom?
I usually buy my clothes at the department store.
I was born in 1979.
I remember both of you.
I suddenly became dizzy.
Answer Tom.
Someone broke the window.
Did you iron all the shirts?
Don't forget your sunscreen.
Why don't you ride with me?
Have you been listening to me?
Even the greatest scholar can't solve that.
Our train had already pulled out when we arrived at the station.
Tom has a tattoo on his left arm.
I had dinner with a friend last night.
The shopkeeper went out of her way to help us.
We've already seen this movie.
I had to wait for Tom to finish.
I bought it for ten dollars.
You're not a suspect.
Pour me a glass of wine.
She felt like dancing.
Were you unhappy?
Can you take on the job?
You're unambitious.
Tom has short legs.
Make yourselves comfortable.
My mother always told me that I should put money in the bank every month so I'd have enough money in case of an emergency.
The situation is critical.
Not everyone got along.
You may choose either of the two books.
That girl looks boyish.
I didn't feel like cooking.
This is my phone.
He's thrilled with his new job.
Take a look.
I suggest we put on some clean clothes.
Are you here alone?
I was relaxed.
Don't you know who that is?
Elephants were killed for their ivory.
It's awfully cold this evening.
I don't know anything about it.
There was no one left but me.
That can't last.
We dined at our uncle's.
What are you doing?
There is no school during August.
The game is not over.
Would you like another glass of wine?
I love your place.
It's incredibly powerful.
Eggs are sold by the dozen.
We have to do that together.
Tom is my son's friend.
There are no gods.
Where is this play being performed?
The sun sank slowly below the horizon.
A few important facts emerged after the investigation.
You have two balls.
Now it's time to say good night.
The telephone is red.
He was ambassador to the United Nations.
He was robbed when coming home late at night.
He denied the accusation.
I demand that he be punished.
Where is the rubber duck?
We all stood up at once.
The law is the law.
Which way did you choose?
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
Why do you say that?
She's about the same age as I am.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I do not need money now.
She really hates this way of thinking.
I'll give you a lift.
I guess we could try doing that.
Which way is out?
You will survive.
I think it makes sense.
They have to repair their car.
You're very upset.
I know it's not kosher.
Christmas is soon.
She took advantage of her paid vacation and went skiing.
I don't feel like waiting any longer.
Play it cool.
How long will you be in Boston?
Are you still playing the bassoon?
My father could swim well when he was young.
I've decided to leave on Monday.
Tennis is loads of fun.
Is there anything you need?
Is there a supermarket in this mall?
I can't drink any more beer.
She's still young.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
She turned down our proposal.
Her office is on the other side of the street.
Tom will be surprised to see you.
I won't betray your trust.
You're not allowed to go into that room.
He did it for the money.
There are some things money can't buy.
This is insane.
They trusted you.
I want to cheer you up.
He will arrive in Kyoto tomorrow.
We all deserve respect.
I have a rough idea where it is.
Come and get it.
I left my jacket in the classroom.
I was disappointed when I heard that you couldn't come.
I appreciate your advice.
Farmers are busy working in the field.
They grow flowers in the garden.
He is a teacher.
I feel funny.
Your prophecy has come true.
Is there a flight in the afternoon?
What'll tomorrow's weather be like?
They were really unlucky.
Is that why you called?
I cut across the park.
You're not too late.
He has a hard time remembering names.
That was going to be my next suggestion.
Which team are you on?
Who told you Tom was sick?
I hung my coat in the hall closet.
I wish you'd called first.
Tom's father is a swimming teacher.
You remind me of somebody.
I'm coming with you.
He advertised his house for sale.
I'll take that into consideration.
I lost everything I had.
I appreciate your trying to protect me.
Give the book to whomever wants it.
They all killed themselves.
I had a seizure.
Who's your favorite comedian?
Try to find it.
She married a musician.
What are your true feelings?
The detective I hired called to tell me he has a promising lead.
He gave his seat to the old man.
How was your birthday?
Children can be cruel.
I'll have to explain that to my father.
The situation seems hopeless.
I gave Mary a book.
Wait a bit longer.
I like your house.
Can you stand the pain?
What's your native language?
Do you still want to be an officer?
Don't look at it.
You have to be flexible.
He hopes to visit Paris.
No one is home.
I promised I wasn't going to do this.
We need to conserve ammunition.
That's exactly what I was doing.
I know that this is important for us all.
Let's try another place to eat today.
He will go to New York next month.
It doesn't matter to us if you take a photo from the outside.
They are great friends.
I wasn't at that meeting.
There's food on the table.
My birthday is coming soon.
Do you take American Express?
Just a minute.
This room gets sunshine.
What time did you get home?
That's a lot!
Japanese tourists can be found everywhere.
There are plenty of nice girls out there.
Tom began to brush his teeth.
Are you going away this summer?
He must have been ill.
Everyone stayed calm.
I thought I heard your voice.
Can you identify this?
I can't decide if I'm happy or sad.
The English Channel separates France from England.
You always make that mistake.
Look up the number in the telephone book.
Stealing is wrong.
I can't wait to eat the cake.
Is there something in particular that you want to know?
Can you explain it to me?
Tom told Mary that he thought a hippopotamus could run at a speed of about 30 kilometers per hour.
Don't make me do this.
Tom did something wrong.
It is definite that he will go to America.
I guess you didn't quite understand me.
You can come at any time.
You shouldn't break promises.
You need to wash your hands.
A lot of my classmates think that I'm dumb.
She tied him up.
I don't know what you want me to say.
He has trouble waking up on time.
Tom is moving to Boston.
You'd better go home.
The number of cases of whooping cough is on the rise in the last years.
That war ended in 1954.
Is there anything you don't know?
Your method is better.
We haven't learned how to do that yet.
They're brother and sister.
Could you give me a ride?
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile.
What do you need to know?
Search the house.
That sounds like a great idea.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
My father suggested that we go camping.
You don't have to worry about publicity.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
I know the reason why Tom was angry with them.
You don't look so busy.
Can Tom get a dog?
I know why Tom doesn't do that.
Put the book on the table.
I can't do without her help.
We're leaving this afternoon.
I'm very worried about you.
Don't rock the boat.
Tom promised to tell the truth.
She went on with the work.
She sent me a present in return for my advice.
That hardly seems fair.
Tom's signature is illegible.
It is two miles from here to the park.
That's what Tom promised.
Can we get started now?
He moved close to her.
He wants that a lot.
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore.
I love what I do.
I did the right thing.
It sounds familiar.
Are you ready to go?
You'd better not go out today.
Tom changed.
Tom wants to talk.
I am afraid I ate something bad.
I'm going to buy you a watch.
I get up at six in the morning.
That's what I wish.
Don't they drive you mad?
Is that Tom?
Do you have any grandchildren?
I want to buy them all.
The man was given a life sentence.
He attended the meeting as the company representative.
Is that why you're upset?
I'm very sorry to have troubled you.
Do you have a better idea?
He was not a good speaker.
We've known each other for years.
Doing that is likely to be very hard.
He was drafted into the army.
Close the door.
I've won first prize!
May I come in?
I know all about you.
I recommend we keep our distance.
We must look at the problem from a global point of view.
I'll make you happy.
Tom seemed to know the secret.
Can I get you a drink?
Do we have any more beer?
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
I got a suntan.
These grapes are so sour that I can't eat them.
Tom saw Mary trying to escape.
You need to do more research.
I'd like to find somebody to talk to.
Is there a hospital near here?
I want you to dance with me.
How did you get hurt?
You gotta get more organized.
I can't help feeling sorry for the girl.
We're not really brothers.
I'd love to go on an adventure with you.
I had something planned.
She advised him where he should stay.
What's my room number?
You'll have to wait here.
She is always complaining about my small salary.
I don't feel well at all.
Can you unjam the printer?
You should try doing that.
One of my favorite authors is Herman Melville.
Tom is an intelligent guy.
He is inclined to look at everything from the standpoint of its practicality and is neither stingy nor extravagant.
A ball is floating down the river.
I would give anything to win her back.
Churches are designated on the map with crosses.
I had a cup of tea to keep myself awake.
I was totally isolated.
He can drive a car.
I certainly hope that'll happen.
She picked up beautiful stones.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to win.
He's about the same age as you are.
They were worried about getting caught.
You must pay attention to him.
Would you like me to turn the TV off?
I talked to everybody.
I can't let them catch me.
Isn't it nice?
I sat in the front of the bus.
We should be able to finish this in a day or two.
We have a mutual friend.
I think it's time for me to get a new job.
The two countries are engaged in biological warfare.
There's no need to hurry.
You know very well how it happened.
He's a very fine musician.
How do you know it's true?
I got off the bus.
I tried everything.
He is a gentleman among gentlemen.
They're all against me.
Tom wants to buy some books.
This is theirs.
That's the last thing I remember.
Does that make sense to you?
We're not your enemy.
I'm willing to go anywhere you go.
You will regret this.
You are probably wrong.
Oh! That's too bad.
There was a curtain which was covering the door.
We know that you're a vegetarian.
The pilot explained to us why the landing was delayed.
How old are your kids?
Fold the paper in the middle.
Your book is here.
Chicken pox is a common sickness in children.
How did you find this?
You'll succeed if you try.
Let's finish the job.
What should I do with all this stuff?
I'll help you do that.
She writes me every week.
I know more about you than you realize.
Tom is our best player.
How long have you been together?
History is not his major subject.
I often go abroad.
I think Tom feels the same way.
You saved us all.
People don't say that anymore.
He is not what he used to be.
I almost always take a shower in the morning before going to school.
I continued reading the book.
She doesn't like to leave anything unfinished.
Do you have any small change?
I've just arrived at the station.
Have you ever been a witness in a court case?
Is there enough gravy?
He was late to the appointment due to a traffic accident.
I sometimes dream of my mother.
It took a long time to accustom myself to the noise.
I found the field trip very educational.
We're married now.
I'm between jobs.
I recovered.
Who was your favorite teacher when you were in high school?
I hate my boss.
You've been very helpful.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know where we can get one.
Tom's asleep.
I can't do all of this without help.
Did you receive an invitation?
Everyone wanted to dance.
She got her master's degree three years ago.
He fought against racial discrimination.
We're leaving Boston.
The Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in 1957.
I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
She must be angry.
Ask anybody.
I was deceived by a person who I had thought was a friend of mine.
Can you swim underwater?
I thought that you were able to speak French.
I asked where she lived.
Stay with us.
I thought it was about time we all met.
Do you really think we can help?
I'm not having a good day.
Have you washed the car yet?
I realized what was happening.
Sexual harassment has now become a social issue.
Aren't you contradicting yourself?
You have to go.
I'm drinking water because I'm thirsty.
I wouldn't call this an improvement.
He has two dogs.
I am a fast swimmer.
I'm not sure what this means.
They're right behind me.
Tom made a video about that.
Tom will be wearing a tie.
Why are they so upset?
Turn the radio down.
I would like the least expensive one.
Tom won't retire.
Who will come with me?
The experiment ended in failure.
I'd like to take a short break.
They found out.
I want to know who told you that.
We need proof.
The man couldn't so much as write his own name.
I don't think I can help you.
I do it once a year.
I have a wooden comb.
Is this your briefcase?
Make him work for it.
I really like that girl.
He was not able to marry her.
That's already been done.
Use them all.
You should not sleep.
I don't expect anything from you.
Look at the price.
Could it be that simple?
I know what Tom and Mary are capable of.
The book is small.
I wish somebody would help me do that.
He picked up a mirror and looked at his tongue.
You don't have to answer.
Stop Tom.
I have been reflecting on what you said to me.
Tom always checks to verify that no dyes are in any food he buys.
Why don't you come visit us?
The city is gaining popularity as a major tourist destination.
They expect us tomorrow at 2:30.
This is shameful.
I think this medicine will do you a lot of good.
I don't like your smile.
You cannot prevent him from drinking.
Pick one up while you can.
The rise in house prices enabled him to sell his house at a big profit.
The boat is sinking.
How's your mother?
The bridge connects the two cities.
Would you be kind enough to explain it to me?
I'm more beautiful than you.
I'm not surprised to hear that.
He's right behind you.
This blouse is cotton.
I found the person who did that.
She is able to sing very well.
The dog jumped over a chair.
How can this be done?
You'd better come down here right away.
This is insanity.
Tom is three years older than you.
Stop playing hard to get.
This is the place I told you about.
Are you just going to stand there all day?
Have you seen this man?
Human relationships are very complex.
Please write your name here.
Tom doesn't have enough money to buy what he wants.
Winds from the sea are humid.
What do these markings mean?
I have had an inspiration.
I sent you an e-mail.
You're a weird kid.
He is careful about his manners.
I'm interfering.
It's a miracle.
They made me really angry.
Give me back my pencil.
He pushed the cat into the swimming pool.
Please don't make me laugh. I did too many sit-ups yesterday and my stomach muscles hurt.
What would you like to talk about?
The door will not open.
Buy me a drink.
He won't make it to old age.
That's 20% of the world's population.
He's incredibly talented.
I'm not very patient.
He's three years older than she is.
They bought quite a few books.
No one is that lucky.
She's a very nice girl.
You can't believe anybody.
I'll tell you a secret.
We made waffles.
I'm not interested at all.
Raise up your left hand.
Do you have something to tell me?
Tom ordered a bottle of champagne.
I never want to get married again.
It is not far from the hotel.
You're so picky.
I just want to finish this and leave.
Some diseases are caused by a defective gene.
It's such a beautiful flower.
I thought I was doing the right thing.
Tom wasn't a bright student.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
I'm right.
I can see the light.
Who would do this?
Would you like me to take you home?
We should hang out more.
This is normal.
What sort of people hang out at a place like this?
The child was made a ward of the state.
They're after you.
Mary is cute.
Everyone laughed.
I found a dollar in the street.
He had no objection.
Kids love pasta in tomato sauce.
Where did I put my battery pack?
I went back to work.
How are you feeling tonight?
Tom has asked us for help.
Are you implying something?
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
That should be enough for you.
I told them to study more.
Take care not to catch a cold.
I seldom hear from him.
She asked us several questions.
I appreciate anything you can do.
He likes country music.
We've chosen a hotel near the museums.
I'll phone you every night.
I know that I can trust Tom.
She's a fox.
Rebel forces prepared to fight.
What have you done with the books?
Do you have a reservation?
Did something happen to Tom?
I wish I could take back all those terrible things I said about you last night.
The weather report says it will rain tomorrow afternoon.
I prefer it this way.
I asked a favor of him.
Tom didn't mention any of this to me.
Do you have your driver's license?
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
My car is parked down the street.
I'm not so sure.
I just want to stay here.
I fed the leftovers to my dog.
She gave an oral report to her boss.
I want to know how you know that.
Our feud traces back to our childhood.
I wanted to be a piano teacher.
The students bowed to their teacher.
You're still green.
I want to take advantage of the opportunity to speak to the governor.
She couldn't come because he was sick.
He attained his goal.
You will be better off buying a new one than trying to fix it.
Tom doesn't like to lose.
She will be glad if you go to see her in person.
I love all of you.
Who's the captain of this ship?
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
No correlation was found.
Can you tell me about that conversation?
Tom put the vase on the table.
I need a mouse pad.
You didn't cause it to happen.
Think again.
We should take a coffee break.
I climbed to the top of Mt. Fuji.
I daydreamed all day.
How often do you play hockey?
We still need your help.
What am I up against?
It seems interesting to me.
Look at that good-looking boy.
Tom didn't have to do this.
He was killed by a blunt weapon.
I was about to leave my house when she called.
Can you drive me to the station?
I saw you.
I don't know when he'll come.
It's about time you got a haircut.
She's hot.
I got rid of all my old textbooks.
Can you drive a stick shift?
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
What's your idea?
I don't have a car.
He is a good singer.
She put on her overcoat before going out.
I prefer to go by bicycle.
I eat my breakfast at seven o'clock.
I am off duty tomorrow.
Say please.
The walls were painted light brown.
Tom and Mary had a whirlwind romance.
I don't believe any of this.
You're a dreamer.
I'm really not hungry.
He likes to hunt.
Cool off!
I don't plan on doing that by myself.
He doesn't care if his car is dirty.
What're you saying?
I lost the watch.
I want my dinner brought to my room.
I wake him up at 6 every morning.
She was making tea.
I think she'll succeed.
Let him do as he likes.
We are short of money.
Tom didn't tell his parents that he had gotten an F on the test.
Tom might be right.
It's a personal matter.
I think you may as well tell me.
You're very clever.
I don't believe that anymore.
Business expenses are tax-deductible.
You're a jolly good feller.
That was a funny joke.
The two sides hold talks this week.
I reconsidered your offer.
I want to go to Boston with Tom.
They told me to stay in the car.
I'll help you pack.
She is unconscious.
She has wet hair.
Just remember to have fun.
The girls giggled.
You've come too early.
Your face is always dirty.
How many times a month do you write a letter to your mother?
I'm always happy.
You have beautiful hair.
The TV was on all night.
I have many dreams.
I don't want you to worry.
Why did they do that?
I'll call the cops.
It's time to make a decision.
My father is a teacher.
We shouldn't be fighting with each other.
Do me a favor.
Your hair is beautiful.
Will you take a personal check?
I think I've already given you enough money.
Why does catnip drive cats nuts?
You're unfair.
You know it's a lie.
You have done a wonderful job.
Don't hesitate to call if you need me.
How are you?
Do you really think we can win?
Tom plays the piano every day.
I confessed my sin.
I turned on the lights.
She took a sip of her drink.
Her beauty was beyond description.
We're not the champions.
I'm really happy for you.
Do you play in a band?
I'm taking care of my grandfather.
It's hard being a parent.
I was really mad at Tom.
I don't know what's in this box.
I got the pears for nothing.
I hope your assignment in England was successful.
I read a lot of magazines.
I don't mind walking in the rain.
What can they do?
I don't want to upset you.
How can you ask such a question?
This is a story about a cat.
"Says who? ""Says me."""
Beer's good.
I yelled at Tom.
I thought you might want some breakfast.
I know you recently retired.
I know that would make you happy.
I captured butterflies with a net.
That's why I'm a bachelor.
I don't mean you.
I don't really want to be all by myself.
You need to be more careful from now on.
His story sounds strange.
What kind of sports do you do?
Rules are meant to be broken.
I suggest that your son come to our party.
I'll go with you.
What sort of yogurt do you like best?
Which one of these boxes do you want?
Tokyo has a population of over ten million.
The clock is defective.
Was anybody else there?
We're listening to the radio.
He cheated me.
She spent a good deal of money on her vacation.
We confirmed the hotel reservations by telephone.
We are supposed to take off our shoes at the entrance.
Tom traveled a lot.
Do you want a ticket?
Tom fixed it with a hammer.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
I'm well aware of the risks.
I'm just not sure.
They should have one.
You will need a bodyguard.
It's something my sister never wanted to do.
Are you ready now?
I just try to do what I can.
Do you think something like that will repeat itself?
The game is over.
I'm dying of thirst.
May I ask what you are working on now?
Show me what you can do.
I know you feel lonely.
You all did good work.
Why are these two always fighting?
I should've paid a little more attention.
We must sit down.
Don't do anything like that again.
I called you in here to ask you a question.
Is that all of them?
And with that we finish the activities for today.
My father has many books.
Do you like French literature?
I'm confident that you'll succeed.
Tom was dying.
Please make sure the drinking water is pure.
I still care.
Tom works part-time.
He hardly works.
Someone has stolen all my money.
It saddens me to hear you say that.
What do I have to do to convince you?
Mastering a foreign language requires a lot of hard work.
I was unharmed.
I made that decision on my own.
Here's your drink.
That's not what worries me.
Tom didn't want Mary to move to Boston.
Where did you get on this bus?
I never saw him in jeans.
She argued with him about money.
I feel like I'm going mad.
I don't have my purse.
How big you are!
I know that Tom is boring.
They're not going to be able to find the hotel.
You made a good decision.
This is my dog.
I figured I might find you here.
"How much did you pay for this? ""About 20 euros."" ""Wow! That's incredibly cheap."""
What would the world be without women?
My hands are stained with paint.
I'll go.
We know it was our duty.
You're good.
She failed every time she tried.
I flunked out of school.
I think there's only a slim chance of that happening.
Tom's house burned down.
He's addicted to heroin.
Let's go into the garden.
This is a pretty amazing place.

How did you know one was missing?

I know it's not fair.
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
We should be proud of ourselves.
Tom didn't let us do that.
Tom tried to control his emotions.
There's nothing I can do.
When can you start?
I think it's time for me to step aside.
Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
I agree with you on this point.

I was watching television at the time.
Just be quiet.
They believe in God.
I could be next.
I don't know if Tom still lives in Boston.
Why won't you trust me?
Let me write down the address.
I remember that guy.
Is there something in there?
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
You're a good man.
You're taller than I am.
We didn't tell you that.

I hate you.
Are you going to sing with us?
Can you direct me to the post office?
I'm going to teach you a lesson.
I'm afraid I have internal bleeding.
He was perfect.
I know what you did.
I have one.
I wonder if you could help us.
We can't allow Tom to do that.
Do you think that you could help me weed the garden this afternoon?
We'd better not change the schedule.
Open the bottle.
Come with me now.
I'm not going to go.
What were you dreaming about?
The robber was nabbed this morning.
We know they'll come.
I oiled my bicycle.
We had to stop.
Don't be upset.
Please write down my address.
This is extortion.

Do you want to go?
I have a debt to pay.
I'm here to ask for your help.
I count on your help.
Are you ready to go?

We're still in shock.
I had to work overtime yesterday.
You're so mean.

I'm very upset.
The light is on in Tom's room.
Do you really want to know?

What is the good of doing it?
Is there a problem?

This week is Fire Prevention Week.
Tom came after everybody else had left.

Tom asked Mary to wait for him here.
I'm glad you brought that up.
He decided neither to advance nor to retreat.
I'll never leave you.
I study English at home.
You know I don't have any money.
There's so much I want to tell you.
You won't believe what I've got.
My heart was filled with sorrow.
I met Tom in October.
This gives me the strength to go on.
You can't hurt me anymore.
Look in front of you.
Tom sorted his laundry.
We'll be back in an hour.

The student made an irrelevant remark.
A lot of soldiers died here.
I'm glad you're here today.

I think it's time for me to confront that problem.
Let's change the subject.
I'm sure that's wrong.
Do you know what I mean?
I saw him cross the road.
This door would not open.
They're looking for you.
She went down to the fifth floor.
I have almost no appetite.
Where ever did you buy it?
His height is a great advantage when he plays volleyball.
They don't trust you.
They're expensive.
Are you seriously thinking about going?
I like it when you do that.
I want my bicycle back.
Pardon the interruption.
He doesn't have a hat on.
He'd prefer to go on Friday.
That's quite logical.
What are you doing for Christmas?
What a lot of pens!
This is not my first time riding a bicycle.
It may snow.
I'll have what he's having.
Your parents can't keep us apart forever.
You've already given me enough money.
May I ask a few questions?
What sports do you like?
I'd like to give Tom something special for his birthday.
I wish we had won the game.
It's a waste of resources.
We're not lost. I know where we are.

Are you watching your weight?

I'm not asleep.

Did you buy Tom a dog?
I'm definitely going crazy.
It's really quite cold.
I need some cash.
Read this first.
We work together.
I know I disappoint you sometimes.
I have to keep my mind on this important question.
Change is possible.
You will need a bodyguard.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
I gave you fair warning.
How can you be so callous?
Can you tell me about that conversation?
He caused his parents a lot of anxiety.
I thought you'd be full after eating that big steak.
I must go alone.
I saw a shape in the dark.
Japan is to the east of China.
Who was the man you were talking to?
A pretty waitress waited on us.
They're headed this way.
I'm not your friend.
My grandmother looks after the children during the daytime.

Your T-shirt's on backwards.
I want to live forever.
I caught a trout.
I thought you had more sense than that.
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
He needn't have come himself.
He's just a business associate.
I lit the match.
I'll be late.
No mountain in Japan is higher than Mt. Fuji.
I've never been able to handle responsibility.
It rains a lot in Okinawa.
I'm not going to study French anymore.
How did you find me?
Is that a no?
That's the problem.
I don't know why it's taking so long.
Does this actually make you happy?
That's very flattering.
The meeting broke up at nine o'clock.
She advised him to take a long holiday.
Not everyone needs a college degree.
I think that's highly unlikely.
You do nothing else but eat.
Don't worry. I'll be right back.
What time does your plane leave tomorrow?
Isn't life just great?
The television doesn't work.
Tom's new wife's name is Mary.
Tom seems to want to say something.
Do you want to read this magazine?
I think Tom could be persuaded to help.
I think he did it.
Tom graduated.
Invite him over to watch a movie.
I'll show you the way out.
What're you going to do about it?
The door was closed.
I haven't eaten anything unusual since I've returned home from my trip around the world.
Who's your girlfriend?
Tom is looking for Mary.
How many calories have you had today?
Keep your room as neat as you can.
Any improvement is good.
I'll sleep on the floor.
That wasn't Tom's choice.
You're the best.
Did you go to school today?
That was a good idea.
We're from the same neighborhood.
I know next to nothing.
He explained to my son why it rains.
I just can't believe they're getting married.
The medicine had no effect.
Where are you hurt?
I think we're doing a good job.
I want to ask you a question.
You don't look Japanese.
We're running a little late.
I checked twice.
Get us out of here.
We lost.
They did not feel like playing any more.
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
Don't you read the tabloids?
I want to leave school.
A piece of bread was not enough to satisfy his hunger.
A man who wanted to see you came while you were out.
I'll give you a lift home.
Do you need an ambulance?
Tom can't ski.
The jets took off one after another.
The evidence is fairly conclusive.
Try not to eat too much.
We should do everything ourselves.
The two sisters lived very peacefully.
Do you know where I live?
You seem to know everything about this.
I know Tom is a specialist.
It's quite large.
He's just arrived.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
I'm beginning to feel a little hungry.
It was a waste of time.
Do you live alone?
She divorced him after many years of unhappiness.
Speak for yourself.
I'll have lunch waiting for you.
We shouldn't have tried to help Tom.
Give me your watch.
I'd like to go through just one day without being told I need to grow up.
I'm not unhappy.
I remember laughing.
I did my part.
I saw him with my own eyes.
The law was changed.
A coat is an article of clothing.
You should keep your promises.
My little brother always sleeps with his teddy bear.
Stay out of this.
Don't make me go.
Tom thinks he's the only person in town who can play the bagpipes.
I'm not a perfectionist.
I have some time.
I couldn't have solved this case without you.
Have you ever eaten at this restaurant?
I admire your courage.
How do we find it?
Your friends sound nice.
That's not exactly what I said.
We do that all the time.
Maybe what you said is true.
This should be fun.
We miss you very much.
Are you ready to go?
We have something in common.
I'm not mentally prepared for that.
The car came to a smooth stop.
I want you to return the book I lent you the other day.
Are you excited?
The doctor arrived in the nick of time.
I thought it must be something like that.
Do you eat a lot?
His company didn't survive the crisis.
Why did Tom do that?
I need a computer.
When is he expected back?
I had a pleasant experience on my trip.
That might be serious.
Maybe we should talk about this first.
I work as a consultant.
You're careful.
Tom used to be a truck driver.
I suggest we hurry.
There are no roses without thorns.
She has buried her only son.
We haven't been invited yet.
He is studying history at the university.
We all work.
I tried writing with my left hand.
Who would buy something like that?
I have no place to sleep tonight.
I need a holiday.
She seems rich.
She became very ill.
What difference would it make if people did that?
I guess that's not such a big secret.
He did what I wanted right away.
I can take care of that immediately.
I'm sorry.
Can't you see I'm busy?
You can't be sure of that.
Don't make me beg for it.
Did you really dance with Tom?
You took advantage of me.
Who did that to you?
I think I'll do that.
He is too busy dreaming dreams to plan what he will do in his old age.
What was it that brought you to me?
What are you talking about?
This looks like a gunshot wound.
I know what you were doing.
What have you heard?
Stir the paint with a stick.
You must not forget to wake me tomorrow morning.
I made up my mind to go there.
Where did you spend your holidays?
I thought it was just a metaphor.
Why do you interrupt me all the time?
You left your lights on.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
I gave them a present for their anniversary.
It's a very urgent matter.
Tom has braces on his teeth.
It's up to you to decide whether we'll go there or not.
Who will look after your dog?
I left the room.
Tom arrived at midnight.
The day is almost over.
It may rain any minute.
He is late.
Those are your options.
Why does Tom drink so much?
There is an apple on the desk.
You're a filthy liar!
Talk to me.
You changed it?
I think nobody's home.
Why are you angry?
Tom goes to the barber less than four times a year.
I thought it was funny.
He was shot 3 times in the arm.
Here's the map that you were looking for.
I have to see this movie.
Why were you laughing?
Would you be happier if I stayed?
It's very likely Tom will do that.
I think I understand the pressures you are under.
It needs washing.
You're a monster.
The prosperity of a country depends upon its citizens.
Are you sure that you know what to do?
I've never been a superstitious person.
You are no longer welcome here.
We'd like a double room with bath.
He got hooked on drugs at a young age.
I live about a mile from here.
Let's stay focused.
This is a wonderful achievement.
I have no idea where we are.
He'll take care of that.
I need envelopes.
This building is ancient.
She stole my clothes!
It's about time you got married.
Tom doesn't know how much Mary weighs.
I'm so sorry that I lied to you.
It's a cloudy day.
I'm good at languages.
The green lampshade casts a warm glow in the room.
Tom is drunk as a skunk.
She's not here.
What exactly am I paying for?
I almost did it.
I was unlucky.
Are you sincere?
Who did you see in the park?
Aren't you embarrassed?
She is really in good health.
Do you have a nail file?
Tie your shoelaces.
You're not that smart.
Tom doesn't have the will power to quit smoking.
He made an important scientific discovery.
Was anyone hurt in the train crash?
It is likely to rain today.
Time travel is possible.
They look cool.
He took over his father's business.
I'm sure everything will be OK.
Tom seems to be sympathetic.
I'm not surprised you don't remember.
He gave me a smile of recognition.
You never should've done that.
You can do it if you put your mind to it.
You hit the bullseye.
Let's all help Tom do that.
What a hypocrite!
They entered into a heated discussion.
We were just playing.
You can park on either side of the street.
He is still on his back.
He is suffering from a serious illness.
People like to talk to you.
This milk has a peculiar taste.
I lost the game.
You are not our friend.
You remind me of your mother.
Is that all you wanted to tell us?
Can you determine what happened?
I accompanied her on a walk.
Worrying never does you any good.
He felt it was his duty to go.
I need help painting the fence.
Tom drinks a little.
I need some get-up-and-go.
Where did you see that woman?
She strongly resembles her grandmother.
Leave the bottle.
He had an accident at work.
I wonder why tennis is played in mini-skirts.
Here is your change.
I only did my duty.
You may give this picture to whoever wants it.
He is too honest to tell a lie.
I miss my family and my friends.
I can't blame you for dreaming.
I can't calculate the distance.
How much are these shoes?
I'm not very busy.
Everything is quiet.
Tom's packing.
You must not stay up late.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Opposition to the embargo was growing.
Why don't you start by telling us where you went?
Tom bought a bottle of olive oil.
Nobody came to the party.
It's the sort of day when you'd like to stay in bed.
Tom doesn't remember turning off the light.
They love coffee.
It's been a long time since I last spoke French.
I'll hang onto it for now.
I need a break.
Did Tom call while I was out?
Don't you have any good news?
Cook for me.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
She said that she saw a suspicious man.
That happens to us a lot.
Are you saying I smell bad?
Do you want a salad?
No one believed you.
I wanted to make sure we didn't cause the problem.
I'm giving it back.
That's all Tom said.
She has just turned twenty.
She's no spring chicken.
Don't worry about a thing.
Neither is true.
They robbed me blind.
He's checking his cellphone.
I'm surprised you didn't know that.
My husband is away for the weekend.
The number of employees doubled in ten years.
Here it is.
He was always faithful to his wife.
Silence is golden.
The priest married them last Sunday.
I get dizzy when I stand up.
Won't you come to my house next Sunday?
I was impressed with what I saw.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
He collected a lot of stamps.
We are all happy to help.
I think it's very nice.
I want the same jacket as you are wearing.
Zip up your coat.
I know your roommate.
Can I have a moment with you?
This doesn't fit.
You must show respect to your guests.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
What's the world's highest mountain?
We have a party tonight.
My house faces the sea.
It is believed that whales have their own language.
It's not as big a problem as you think.
Why are you so insecure?
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
Snakes are cold-blooded creatures.
I can't speak French at all.
How do I know you're not bluffing?
He was not able to join in the discussion.
I'm perfect for you.
Please turn the television on.
I didn't go to the funeral.
I'll live on welfare.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
Are we going to lose?
I suppose that's true.
I did what I had to do.
I hear Tom was the one who taught you how to play the cello.
I'm feeling really sick.
They met each other halfway.
You're conscientious.
I took Highway 58.
Won't you come and see me this weekend?
This doesn't happen often.
I'm going to hide somewhere near here.
She's about the same height as you.
You've risked enough.
Everyone's a winner.
Are you through with the newspaper?
I saw a cottage in the distance.
You look positively ghastly.
Tom handed Mary a knife so she could peel the apples.
We don't need it anymore.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
How much candy did Tom eat yesterday?
I'm not surprised you don't know the answer.
You don't even know who that man was.
I love trying new things.
I'm not sure.
It's no use trying anything.
Rinse with warm water.
More students apply to the university than can be accepted.
You must study your whole life.
Go grab a drink.
His hair has turned white.
Let me borrow that.
You should take care of yourself.
Have you ever argued with your manager?
I agree with him on that point.
You can read this book.
We were on the train for ten hours.
You need to come home right now.
May I drink alcohol?
He kept all the windows open.
Could we not talk about this?
A few minutes' walk brought him to the zoo.
Turn the hose off.
I want everything to be just right.
She attempted to persuade her father.
Don't ask me to explain it.
I hope it'll clear up soon.
My internet connection was cut off.
Is it possible to land a plane on this island?
He hasn't arrived yet.
She is proficient in French.
The medicine worked marvels.
He caught a terrible cold.
Everybody is sleeping.
We won't forgive you.
Make it as spicy as you can.
No criminal charges were filed.
Did you kill anybody?
Tom will be famous.
I'd like to go home now.
Did anyone see you there?
He lives above me.
You're full of surprises.
Don't you just love a mystery?
He was the first to help him.
I've read every one of those books.
Tom lost his hat.
He himself tried it.
Baby teeth are sharp.
He has an interesting book.
Are you free this weekend?
I asked you last night.
I owe you a sincere apology.
Let's go swimming with Tom.
I must have made a mistake somewhere.
I talked to everybody.
I am thinking of going abroad next year.
He was not conscious of his own mistake.
The FBI secretly bugged the mobster's hangout.
I think you'd better come back home.
Tom killed a man.
I don't often drink tequila.
Don't talk to Tom.
I love Italian food.
He lay on his back on the bed.
Tom took a bath last night.
You drink too much coffee.
The subject has not yet been fully explored.
Why didn't you tell us that there was a witness?
Do you have a lawyer?
I have a good sense of smell.
He doesn't know yet.
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
I want you to help me die.
Place it wherever you like.
It was time for lunch.
This is a great book.
How many books can I take out at one time?
I'd like to get together as soon as possible.
You're all fired.
Pungent fumes arose from the chemical mixture.
Your answer was wrong.
Tom is used to working hard.
Tom is being very cooperative.
Don't talk about my family.
May I have a drink?
Is that Tom's daughter?
Let's not waste this chance.
Be honest with me.
I'm lying on the grass.
I think we could help each other.
I did that which she asked me to do.
It's finally my turn.
Everyone always asks me that.
I'll be back.
I rent a room by the month.
I was curious to know why people had been staring at me.
They told me Tom was dead.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
She declared that she was not guilty.
Tom spends about an hour a day practicing the piano.
I don't speak fast.
Are you closer to your mother or to your father?
I appreciate your support.
Hurry up and bring me something to drink.
You're not telling me the whole truth.
You know very well how it happened.
It may be the last time.
I can't believe you turned down that job.
I'm fed up with her.
Would you buy that?
I understand completely.
Are you trying to impress me?
I'm sorry I hurt you.
He thinks he knows everything.
I'm living in the city.
Tom said he thought Mary was scared.
How can this work?
The president governs for four years.
This desk is too heavy to lift.
No one believed me.
Many friends saw him off.
His aim is to become a doctor.
Tom smiled halfheartedly.
Getting your message across is much more important than trying to say it exactly like a native speaker would say it.
I think we should hire Tom.
Tie your shoes.
What did you do with that book?
Why did you call?
Tom didn't know he'd hurt anybody.
He was a bit embarrassed.
This is from Spain.
That's what I've always said.
That was nothing.
The time bomb exploded with a loud noise.
Don't leave us.
Bring a lunch.
Forget I said anything.
These are my reading glasses.
Evil sometimes wins.
You must be in love.
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
What's this green stuff?
I just don't want to see you get disappointed.
I need glue.
Do you think there's a hope?
Be more precise.
I wonder who.
She knows everything about cooking.
What's your favorite breakfast food?
Tom may not want to do that.
I am watering the flowers.
The room was full of smoke.
Get back in the van.
I like French cooking.
It's an easy victory.
Sorry for being late.
It was frustrating and confusing.
How could they not know?
I don't want to stop.
I did everything I was supposed to do.
Do you want this?
I consider watching television a waste of time.
Here's what we found.
These fireworks are spectacular!
I figured you'd understand.
You got here too early.
I think the box has something in it.
Tom claims he knows nothing about Mary.
I forgot the map.
You can't blame her for not knowing what she hasn't been taught.
What did you want to talk to me about?
You are early.
We know it works.
She kept various kinds of pets.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants him to do.
They all need attention.
How do you know that?
The dog sniffed her luggage.
Tom didn't go to the dance.
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
You're so beautiful in that dress.
Have a nice day.
I like your country a lot.
I never thought of that before.
We're not ready for this.
We're still active.
You will survive.
I couldn't understand the announcement that was just made.
Tom said he wanted to go swimming.
Did you miss me?
I have seen it a lot.
I don't like to be away too long.
The book you're looking for is on my desk.
I wanted to do something nice for you.
Tom handed Mary some money.
We're also out of eggs.
This is a sociological study on abortion.
You look sad today.
Tom didn't do that very much.
A dairy cow is a useful animal.
She's an intelligent young woman.
I expect you to give me an answer by this afternoon.
You misunderstood me.
I hard-boiled an egg.
I'm a pretty good student.
You have little to gain and much to lose.
Remember what Tom told us.
Tom is wearing a coat that is too large for him.
I know that Tom was unfair.
They'll get out of class in forty minutes.
Where do you suppose you'll spend your vacation?
This animal is very clever.
You've got a great memory.
I knew that Tom was a bum.
The ugly duckling turned into a beautiful swan.
Every person is special.
We'll try to be more careful the next time.
Did you buy these for me?
Would you like to try it again?
I'm afraid that there isn't any coffee left.
I wish that we could spend more time together.
When do you plan to check out?
I want you to get off my back.
Where did you get that piece of wire?
That's why I called.
When did you seed the lawn?
I've never cared about such things.
I'll see you around.
My mother didn't mention it.
I couldn't lie to you.
I'll call back a bit later.
That TV station broadcasts only movies.
She'll tell him about it when she comes back.
There are no limits.
I smelled bacon.
I really love cats.
He found me a nice tie.
I can not answer your question.
I would like to go to Russia sometime.
You're preaching to the choir.
Mr. Jackson is our history teacher.
Let's find something we can agree on.
Slavery was not abolished in the United States until 1865.
My bike was stolen last night.
It rained a lot last summer.
Can you tell me how?
He has money.
Is there anyone here?
I don't think that Tom realizes how rude he's being.
This is creepy.
He is a fast speaker.
He set out for Tokyo this morning.
I got up a minute ago.
I won't follow you.
She didn't like him at first.
I shouldn't have asked you that.
They quarreled.
Who's your boyfriend?
I can do it.
Food is necessary for life.
You'll have to answer for your behavior.
I like to travel alone.
I always do things the same way.
She has a cat. The cat is white.
I chose him a nice tie.
We have another ten miles to walk before sunset.
Are you finished with your work?
Tom wanted to spend some time in the country.
He is sick.
The answer was right in front of me.
Just call me when you're done.
I don't want to discuss it anymore.
Tom won the contest.
My father used to say that time is money.
Would you be willing to help me clean the garage?
A ring and some cash are missing.
I need to talk to Tom urgently.
I'm mistaken.
She's about the same age as my older sister.
Tom said he found something under the couch.
Tom is still in the classroom studying.
Tom described the problem in detail.
I can hardly swim.
Do you accept the explanation?
I think we shouldn't have gotten married.
The nurse checked Tom's pulse.
Do you want to go fishing with me?
I get very angry when you don't answer my questions.
It was pretty incredible.
We're resourceful.
I like to dress this way.
I thought you were serious.
I was really shocked.
Be careful when you cross the street.
I will take the one that is more expensive.
I can't do it right away.
You should've turned left.
I'm committed.
You are twice as strong as I am.
I'd have waited for you.
Why did you only stop the foreigners?
I'm falling.
Tom is driving without a license.
The house Tom built is really nice.
We left the house together.
I hope you won't expect results immediately.
She nursed him back to health.
I told you that my dad died when I was thirteen.
Just leave me alone.
I thought you were my friend.
This suitcase is too heavy for you.
You're vulgar.
I know Tom wasn't joking.
I've broken enough rules for one day.
Tom can't swim as well as Mary can.
Why don't you trust me?
There's no way to predict what you will dream tonight.
We all consider your idea to be impractical.
They don't know about it.
You're an irresponsible idiot.
Tom is a physician's assistant.
She defeated him.
That's all they wanted.
I was disgusted.
All journeys begin with a first step.
This is the flag of Japan.
How'd it work out?
I'm sick of hearing the same thing all the time.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
The Indians were not happy with this agreement.
A bear will not touch a dead body.
It's not Tom Mary has been protecting.
Tom didn't believe Mary.
He doesn't take vacations.
She works in a bank.
How long have you been divorced?
How do they wish to receive their money?
Do you know how to use it?
Why do you have that?
What'll grow in this soil?
Is this your daughter?
What're you all dressed up for?
We were all devastated.
The potato was so hot that it burned my mouth.
They can't hurt you.
Don't be ridiculous.
Everybody knows that Tom likes Mary.
You need to stay there.
We don't have a daughter.
His reason for not going is still unclear.
She got me a tiny toy.
Tom translated the letter into French for me.
It is said that he is the richest man in the world.
I had a quick breakfast.
He seemed to like that.
Tom is only thirty years old.
Everyone is special.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
I can't find my bicycle.
I am afraid it is a reject.
Tom is a candidate.
You shouldn't eat this.
I know that Tom is depressed.
There were too many children in the pool.
This is your bedroom.
I became acquainted with your father yesterday.
I hope it does not rain tomorrow.
Are you happy with that?
I don't believe that either.
I like Boston a lot.
We sent out the invitations yesterday.
I don't work here.
I'm trying to think of some ideas for this article I'm writing.
Could someone hand me a knife?
Tom became weak.
I'm just no good at this.
I went to the market.
May I ask you a personal question?
Did you hurt yourself?
It's a pleasure to be here.
It really was hard.
Many thanks.
Tom doesn't know you.
I'm a teacher.
What kind of funeral do you want?
I'll be grateful if you can do that for me.
He is known as a rock singer.
I am very glad school is over.
Would you like to leave a message?
Thanks for your invitation to the party.
I figured I might find you here.
Tom didn't get a chance to thank Mary for all her help.
I will never forget this.
Don't speak.
Do you have a younger sister?
The tragedy of war must not be forgotten.
I won!
His name is known throughout this country.
Tom is in the garden pulling weeds.
This guy is a crook.
I fell asleep around midnight.
I'm pretty sure Tom wasn't there.
That was so cool.
You're nothing but a coward.
There's nowhere for you to hide.
Give me your sword.
Thanks for the hint.
I wasn't feeling very well.
I think that this was not a wise decision.
I looked him in the eyes.
I will have my sister pick you up at the station.
I stayed indoors because it rained.
Tom scrubbed the bathtub.
It's convenient for me to see you at ten tonight.
People are complicated.
You have no idea.
He was involved in a traffic accident.
I'm going to the police.
She promised to meet him at the coffee shop.
We can seat you soon.
The children returned home at dusk.
Don't worry about what I did.
Tom sent Mary a birthday card.
This is the boy who helped me.
Take any two cards you like.
I'm focusing on my job.
I'd like to invite you to dinner.
I think this is the only way to do it.
You're contagious.
Tom refused to sign the document.
You're cruel.
I've been looking for them for more than one hour.
You're crafty.
Maybe Tom can be persuaded to help us.
Tom still lives at home.
What did he want to know about me?
I had such high hopes for you.
My mother made a sweater for me.
He was brought up by her grandmother.
It was really cold.
My dog doesn't bite.
He let the dog loose in the yard.
We imported this from Australia.
He loves you as much as I do.
Please come in.
Don't let anything stand between you and success.
I have a burning pain here.
Do you have any children you haven't told me about?
I have to open my shop.
He dropped in on me.
There's no free lunch.
Watch carefully.
Tell me all the details.
Do you want to see my room?
People like Tom lie all the time.
I promised I'd tell you the truth.
I used to wear glasses.
How do you spell your last name?
Tom promised me he would be here by 2:30.
I can't go on with this.
I owe somebody something.
I feel secure with him.
The apple was cut in two by her with a knife.
The weather is getting worse.
I seldom eat dessert.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
He ran out of money.
I wrote down his phone number.
The Japanese art of flower arrangement is called Ikebana.
That's an abuse of authority.
She left her ticket at home.
I could have prevented this.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
Snap out of it!
You like elephants.
Tom is terrible at cooking.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
I'm interested in your work.
He admitted that he was guilty.
Tom has written several books.
I grew up near the ocean.
You don't have what it takes to be a leader.
You shouldn't do such a thing.
There is a map on the wall.
I was stung by a bee.
I'm sorry if I frightened you.
He is not what he was.
I'm just a little bored.
They're idiots.
Don't try this at home.
I thought you hated me.
I felt betrayed.
Is today your birthday?
You're forgetful.
How did you get so strong?
I felt myself being lifted up.
We're divorced.
It's a good thing.
A father and son represent two generations.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
You've got to be bold!
She picked me an apple.
He was terribly poor when he was young.
That's a depressing story.
Keep focused on your goals.
We arrived tired and hungry.
Tom will continue.
She lives with him in a small apartment.
Help me and I will help you.
There's nothing surprising about that.
I just want you to know how sorry I am.
He has very bad luck.
I'll be discreet.
Here's the plan.
Tom explained the decision.
You're old enough to know better.
That's the reason we're here.
Can we fix this?
I felt myself lifted up.
When did you start having vertigo?
I'm very surprised to see that.
Would you like to have lunch together?
She is distantly related to him.
An android is a kind of robot.
I often played soccer when I was young.
The dog marked its territory.
How long have you been a doctor here?
He goes to bed at eight o'clock.
It's a good way to make friends.
I asked her out on a date.
Didn't that strike you as odd?
I'm loved by my parents.
Who would like to go first?
My grandfather's photograph is on the wall.
I don't feel like speaking German.
How did Tom escape?
He's on the dance floor.
I looked in the cupboard.
What time's your train?
I don't watch television.
He's not home.
I'm looking for a job.
Call Tom.
How did you open that box?
I've married the wrong person.
A storm confined them to the house.
She stared at me.
I'll never forget all the help you've given me.
You're creative.
I loved high school.
It is really time for us to go.
It'll be hard to convince Tom to help us.
I feel dizzy.
Have you looked in the bottom drawer?
Tom tells me you're his assistant.
Tom went inside.
She is pleased with her new dress.
Have you asked if they want one?
Aren't you too young for that job?
I'd like a little more water.
Lincoln was elected President in 1860.
Who's the pizza for?
Are you able to swim well?
These are the originals.
He lost a fortune in the stock market.
Don't listen to Tom. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
I won't be back for a while.
That's why I lied.
She combed her hair and bound it with a ribbon.
The paper is white.
Excuse me. May I get by?
What just happened?
He gave me a smile of recognition.
I don't think I can do that.
I want to buy a book.
It was ten degrees below zero this morning.
We're both teachers.
He's crazy about her.
Everybody hates Tom.
This place smells bad.
Everybody has already left.
I really appreciate your company.
I eat my breakfast in the office.
We talked a lot about you yesterday.
I hope this trip isn't a waste of time.
Just answer the question.
Tom owes Mary thirty dollars.
I've got nowhere to go.
She belted out tune after tune at the karaoke bar.
Please remind me to mail the report tomorrow.
I don't want to be involved in that matter.
Were you one of them?
What's causing the delay?
Can you teach me how to drive?
Why are we wasting time with this?
I was a shy child.
What choices do we have?
It's nice to be appreciated.
I've been studying French for a very long time.
It's dark in here. Do you have a flashlight?
How long will it take to get there?
It doesn't matter if you stay or not.
You're the one who suggested buying this computer.
Wait! I'm coming!
My TV is broken.
What's your favorite racing game?
How should I respond?
I write almost every day.
Find the differences.
I can't drink coffee without sugar.
Everybody loved Tom.
I hate being alone this time of year.
They need to change their mindset.
I'm sure that our team will win.
He seems quite happy.
Do you have something for me?
You'll have a hard time.
Where are you sleeping tonight?
That can have serious consequences.
That sounds really bad.
They obeyed.
That's all you get.
The scene was quite touching.
We have no extra money.
It's started.
Did you hear it?
He is more clever than wise.
I know I can count on you all.
Are you enjoying it?
That noise woke me up.
She's not penniless.
Your opinion doesn't matter.
He gave body and soul to his job.
I was pretty relaxed.
I know you don't trust us.
I'll be there in a sec.
I woke you up.
That's what makes this so difficult.
I want you to come to my wedding.
The product is vacuum-sealed to keep it fresh.
It's unforgettable.
Be discreet.
Your watch is on the desk.
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
Tom was surprised by what he saw.
Do you want me to leave you alone?
That's not how.
My bike is nothing like yours.
Tom was a school bus driver before he became a taxi driver.
I have some pictures to show you.
This is your only chance.
I didn't think you would come.
You can't win every time.
Tom is sincere.
She never stops complaining.
I just want to be certain that it's OK.
Tom is going to get angry if you keep doing what you're doing.
We spent a lot of time with them.
Don't make me laugh!
He committed suicide by taking poison.
I should've taken that more seriously.
Tom doesn't want to go alone.
Do you know how that feels?
They crushed all resistance.
I'm very drawn to you.
We finally have you where we want you.
It was the great lung-power of Caruso that made him a great singer.
We won't have time to do anything else today.
He calculated that it would cost him 100 dollars.
He will also go.
I'm not busy either.
I'm too old for such things.
Can you do that today?
Have you ever been to Boston?
I was counting on you.
Why do you need it?
Do you charge for delivery?
I wasn't sure if I was going to make it.
We can't help you anymore.
I have already written a letter.
I was absent from school yesterday.
She divorced him after many years of unhappiness.
Can you explain what PKO stands for?
I need to change my tires.
It turned out to be true.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
When did you arrive? Did you arrive today?
You are nothing but a student.
I brushed my hair.
I wasn't told where we were going.
May I begin?
I want to meet Tom.
We'll figure something out.
I can't believe you're really here.
She looks like her mother.
I'd like to ask a question.
He believes in the supernatural.
Dinner smells delicious.
Tom sat near the window.
I don't need your praise.
Tom sucked his thumb until he was three.
I have a throbbing pain here.
This is too important to overlook.
Head north.
He's not in.
I used to hate doing this.
We'll pick Tom up on the way.
I have to see it all.
I love my mom.
I wonder why so many of these nails are bent.
My sister is bugging me.

He took a short cut.

I think that he is right.
Have you ever had a girlfriend?
I didn't think you were home.
Keep it.
This is a hundred dollar bill.
He felt perfectly content.
I shouldn't have gone there by myself.
I thought Tom told you what you had to do.

We need to discuss this further.
Watch the door.

I could use a drink.
That's why I left.
I've been looking all over for you.
Did anybody sing with you?
Never tell me a lie again.
Is there a timetable?
This is how you do it.
It looks like you came prepared.
It's an unusual name.
He would let me help him.
Why do you study?

They're quicker than we are.
This is something new.
Give me your money!
Drop it!
It's not the same anymore.
My mother said that she was all right.
I wrote the book.
We went on foot.

I haven't the faintest idea.
That was the first time that a man walked on the moon.
I was so humiliated.
Is it something serious?
She's not admitting her mistake.
Is he married or single?
Go ahead.
You have to come with me.
Five thousand dollars is a large sum of money.
Would you be friends with me?
How do I get in touch with you?
I know you don't want to talk about what happened.
You can trust him to keep his word.
Stop grumbling.
I don't plan on retiring yet.
Please try again.
That's not happening.
Don't talk to Tom.
Tom is the boy I told you about the other day.
You're resourceful.
It's really different from what I expected.
Make another choice.
Neither of my brothers will be there.
I have a friend who is a pilot.
He denies having done it.
What can I help you with?
Many people who hear Tom speaking French think he's a native speaker.

I brought you a present.
You should be more reasonable.
I did it for the money.
He stood up and took a deep breath.
I'll handle this one.
Do you know what they want?

How is this possible?
He wants to live closer to nature.

Is this beef or pork?
It rained for three days.
I am to meet him at six.
How dare you treat me like a criminal!
Don't you just hate this kind of movie?
I haven't made a decision yet.
No one seemed to hear.
I've lost weight.
It has been wonderful.
I'm shy.
I am working on my new book.
Bread is made from wheat.
I'll let you know later.
Somebody threw a brick through my window.
I just had the weirdest dream.
Which one of your guitars do you enjoy playing the most?
We have no way to verify this.

She can handle it.
That is very exciting.
There's no escape.
I can't order Tom to do it.
Are you going to buy that?
Do you want to ask me a question?

I don't want you to be hurt.
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
She was feeling kind of tired.
She gave me a pretty doll.
We have no comment.
Has the movie started yet?
Tom is a journalist in Boston.
Call off your dogs.
Read it once more.
I will stay there.
She has two daughters.
Who are these two boys?
He denied it.
My father is busy.
He retired at 65.
He was declared bankrupt.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you wouldn't be late today?
Don't you always do what's expected?
How many people are likely to show up?
I think it's time for me to consult a lawyer.
I said it as a joke.
You aren't ready for this.
We can't afford that anymore.
I'd like to see you in my office.
We just need to stay calm.
She lives two doors down.
Are you mad?
It's not easy to understand his ideas.
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
You should inform your mother as soon as you can.
Tom doesn't want to go to school today.
You've left me no choice.
I'd never played that game before.
He has postponed his departure until tomorrow.
His parents loved me.

They clung together for warmth.
We need assistance.
I doubt it'll be very hard for you to get your driver's license.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
Tom never gets invited to parties.
Am I the only one?
That's a doll.
I know that Tom loves you.
You're being silly.
That's not exactly what I meant to say.
I recently had surgery.
I hope something good happens before the day is over.
They don't listen to me.
I figured you might change your mind.
Come over here and join us.
That will put you in danger.
What are you both doing in here?
I feel uneasy in my father's presence.
The policeman said that it looked like a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
After a storm comes the calm.
This is awkward.
Her anger is understandable.
Let's get off the bus here.
Sorry. I must've dialed the wrong number.
I have a great idea.
Someone broke into my house last weekend.
I didn't bring this topic up with her.
I love my parents.
It's very likely that he'll be late.
Get dressed.
I loved working here with you.
Who knew about this?
Do you still not understand?
Mary's parents hate Tom.
I've made many mistakes in my lifetime.
I can't deal with this problem anymore.
I hid behind the tree.
Do you have any more of those?
It seems that they took the wrong train.
What language do you speak at home?
The word has several meanings.
Let's ask a travel agent.
Is money important to you?
Tom almost cried.

Where was it that you found this key?
I don't want Tom to go to jail.
I don't have one.
It is no good to you.

I owe you a dinner.
He made fun of my accent.
Do you have someplace to stay?
I plan to stay here for three days.
We got all the materials together.
What advice did Tom give you?
She didn't know what to do.
Did you find everything you want?
He held his breath.
You must help her.
That's all I needed to know.
We are not too young to tell what love is like.
We now know that the testimony he gave was coerced.
I'm surviving.
You may still be in luck.
She is too young to know the truth.
She will be there by now.
Are you sure?

Will it be much longer?
The family is watching a movie together.
The nail tore his jacket.
I told you it was dangerous.
Is anyone looking?
My shift's almost over.
I've seen this picture before.
Who cares?
Are you sure?
I think you're being a little too careful.
What are you good at?
We're glad to see you.
I've been a little distracted.
I made a list.
I tried to make the best of it.

I'm fascinated by cats.
I know that I don't want to be married to you.
It's a misunderstanding.
Be more flexible.
I'll show you how to catch fish.
You're out of your mind.
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
I'd have said no.
Let's order a pizza.
I was just wondering if I could borrow three hundred dollars from you. I can pay you back next Monday.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
There is no room for doubt about his guilt.
Do it this way.
I think Tom died.
I don't really understand you.
What a waste of time!
Can I help you find something?
I regret nothing.
Iceland used to belong to Denmark.
He is very sociable.
Don't get the wrong idea.
No one followed me.
I really regret doing that.
You can't handle this alone.
His bag was stolen yesterday.
I don't like playing poker at all.
I lost track of all time during our walk in the woods.
Tom did time for armed robbery.
She spoke Japanese well.
I can't explain what happened.
I saw the two together on several occasions.
Tom was in trouble financially.
Tom is good at diving.
You've risked enough.
I'd love to know that.
I suppose you'll be needing this.
I made dinner.
It depends on many things.
You want to remain anonymous.
We spoke briefly.
All the stores were closed.
We're not fussy.
When's the next shuttle?
No one has the right to tell you how to raise your child.
The date of the party is still up in the air.
I did all the work myself.
I know that what I did was really stupid.
I really should be getting to bed.
Tom used to eat a lot of meat.
You broke the rule.
Does anybody else feel that?
I'm going to stop trying to be friendly with you.
May I see the wine list?
What a beautiful woman she is!
I believed you.
Doing that will be easy.
I'm cleaned out.
What happened to all those people?
Don't worry about such a thing.
Are you insinuating something?
You're blocking my view.
What do you call this?
Tom is outside watering the flowers.
She abandoned her children.
That's about all.
They were plainly dressed.
Why didn't you just leave?
His father is Japanese.
Where is the bathroom?
Thanks for telling me the truth.
I want to visit Korea.
She had achieved her objective.
Do you have an extra key?
Many famous artists live in New York.
There are puddles everywhere.
Take a bite.
Is that not normal?
Did I interrupt something?
I'm going to do something else.
Tom keeps his word.
That's where I injured my ankle.
They make good use of their rooms.
Some of them have committed suicide.
Settle down for a while and concentrate.
Tom loves his work.
Why would you think something like that?
I thought you were going to stay home.
I haven't seen them in a long time.
I'm getting tired of your complaints.
I met her on a certain winter day.
It's OK to take a picture from outside.
There is no way of reaching the island other than by boat.
I have complete confidence in you.
Leave me alone.
That's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it.
I'm very interested in listening to what you have to say.
You know I have to go.
This is not natural.
He is not himself today.
He's after me.
Tom kicked Mary.
I'll do anything I can to help.
You will never be too old to learn.
He couldn't come because he was sick.
Tom went outside to smoke a cigarette.
Tom put on his backpack.
Now it's your turn.
He was so confused that his answer did not make any sense.
We've got bigger problems.
May I eat something?
Can you make it on time?
Why don't you believe me?
The lawyer asked the judge to make allowance for the age of the accused.
Don't tell anyone.
This smartphone uses an ARM processor.
Do you have a map?
I borrowed this book from Tom.
Taking off is easier than landing.
Can you really not swim?
Tom slept on the plane.
I feel betrayed.
The tip of the key broke.
Does the soup taste good?
I'm surprised Tom can't speak French.
I saw you outside.
Write your full name.
Let's try it.
The blood was bright red.
It will become much warmer in March.
She was falsely accused.
Did I ask you?
Advertising is what drives business.
I lent Tom my camera.
I wrote to him for quite another reason.
Someone stole my bicycle.
Hummers are big gas guzzlers.
It's difficult to answer this question.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Tom asked a question.
Tell us a little about yourselves.
I'll get back to you on that.
I'd like to know more about Tom.
Do you really want me to dance with you?
I didn't know Tom had agreed to do that.
Can you handle it?
Why don't you get a job?
A new year always brings hope.
We live in a remote area.
How is this relevant?
I didn't mean to spook you.
Are you able to understand Tom?
Tom built his own house.
This party's packed.
That's the only reason I'm here.
Wonderful!
Who's your favorite player?
That bus stops in front of my house.
He made a mistake on purpose.
I don't know her.
You didn't give me the correct change.
We need an answer.
My nose is bleeding.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
It's transparent.
There are a lot of beautiful roses in our garden.
I was busy cooking.
It's really horrible.
He never said it again.
It's dangerous to swim in this river.
All taxpayers have the right to know where their money goes.
This book is boring.
She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.
I've already answered that question.
Hundreds of people marry each year who have known each other only a few days or weeks.
I think that I should resign.
We should get away from here as quickly as we can.
How's Tom?
How did you reply?
I just can't stop crying.
Children under thirteen years of age are not admitted to this swimming pool.
Does it hurt when you chew?
I was too tired to go on.
What do they need?
Please do not smoke here.
Where the treasure is hidden is still a mystery.
Let's eat out for a change.
That's all I have to say to you.
Call me if anything happens.
I'll tell you a story.
I didn't mean to offend you.
Some animals can sense the coming of a storm.
I have a sharp pain here.
I never promised you anything.
I can't go with you.
Did anyone eat with you?
How far do you live from here?
Are there two windows in your room?
What do you want to drink with your meal?
You don't have to take an examination.
You have problems.
That's so depressing.
It costs an arm and a leg.
My daughter went to school.
She listened to him.
This feels right.
I finally understand.
The boat can still be seen.
Pick a weapon.
Your criticism is unfair.
The steak is well done.
The boy came running.
I have money.
I'll have to take a look.
Ask her what she bought.
Do you really want to win?
I'm smarter than you are.
Tom borrowed my bike.
Which credit cards can I use?
That was my second guess.
I watch television all day long.
You're so impatient.
Once is not enough.
The manager deals with many problems.
I grasped the rope so as not to fall.
Tom got up and walked to the door.
Are you sad?
The government has taken measures to promote domestic industry.
I remember your father.
I want to go to town.
I never knew my father.
Why don't you take a closer look?
I heard something.
Tom hid under the bed with the cat.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Tom was unsatisfied with the results.
It's not very important.
I shouldn't have slept in.
Tom has already headed home.
Tom doesn't read much anymore.
She was accused of telling a lie.
They won.
I have a dictionary.
This summer I went on vacation in Scotland.
Did I give you enough time?
I'm not making any plans.
I have eyes.
He has three brothers.
He won the prize last week.
He can't be older than me.
They left the movie early.
He was deprived of his civil rights.
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
You have only to ask for it.
It rained heavily.
Tom doesn't like Mary.
Everybody saw it.
I have something I have to do.
Tom and Mary have gone.
Is it OK if I open a can?
Could you stay and help me?
That's only my personal opinion.
Is there someone here who speaks French?
This town is increasing in population.
Tom understands French well.
Is it the right place to sign up for foreign language courses?
The bill passed at the last moment.
I'm busy.
Why did you lend money to someone like her?
Can I bring a friend?
He didn't hear his name called.
I really want to figure this out.
I still have a suitcase to unpack.
They can manage.
We have to find another way to do that.
This is how I made it.
I have caught a cold.
The privacy rules we used to follow just don't apply anymore.
I'm really surprised Tom's not here.
The camera you bought is better than mine.
I'm teasing.
Nobody can keep us apart now.
That's what you get for not listening.
Tom said that you wanted to go with us.
You're single.
He sent me some American magazines.
It does seem like an excellent plan.
The atomic number for iron is 26.
Can you guess my age?
You need to stay awake.
Make yourselves comfortable.
What do you want me to say?
I hadn't intended to work at this company this long.
I'm concentrating.
That's all I wanted to say.
Our army attacked the enemy during the night.
We have a complete set of the recordings of Beethoven's symphonies.
I can't do that either.
I will give you the money tomorrow.
How many cans of beer have you drunk?
You know where to find me if you need anything.
I didn't want to disappoint my parents.
I was very motivated to learn French.
Learn these names by heart.
Just say no.
I don't have any problems at all.
You're too suspicious about everything.
You'd better do as the doctor advised you.
I had to walk home.
Don't deny it.
They go to church every Sunday.
I'll know tomorrow.
I believe Tom will be acquitted.
Hang on a minute.
I won't tolerate it anymore.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Did you iron all the shirts?
We're ready to go.
Could you send this letter to Japan?
Would you mind lending me your pen?
Tom is still crying.
How about going on a picnic?
I'll get them.
You're very clever.
A closed fist can indicate stress.
Japan imports a large quantity of oil.
Let's not waste any more of each other's time.
I caught her by the hand.
We have a very serious problem.
He shall have it.
Tom said that he liked me.
I had trouble falling asleep last night.
The three boys had only two dollars among them.
Did it make you angry?
I want Tom to come back.
The summer vacation begins in July.
Take out your notebooks.
She moved out of her parents' house.
You look gloomy.
I'm allergic to shellfish.
They're right behind you.
Aren't you sick of eating here?
What did you see in the kitchen?
The meeting's about to start.
Do you think I should go alone?
Is there any beer left?
How many more forks do we need?
How many combat situations have you been in?
They are investing a lot.
She gave him the brush off.
Did we forget anything?
I found the book easily though it was dark in the room.
I rented a boat by the hour.
She invited me to her home.
How many times a day should I feed my dog?
My bag is too old. I must buy a new one.
Do cats dream?
A mere glance is not enough for us to tell one from the other.
I hope you find it interesting.
I just want you to know I regret it.
Are you fully recovered?
You're lucky nobody saw you do that.
This house is far too small.
I knew you wanted to tell me something.
I didn't mean to give you that impression.
Why do you resist?
You're not normal.
My father is on the wagon.
Coffee is Brazil's main product.
He failed to come on time.
The accident happened in this manner.
Stop staring at me.
It's one of my favorites.
I stayed in bed all morning.
You're not a doctor.
A few people mentioned they would like to attend some sessions later in the day on the Technical Session Agenda.
Are you sure it's impossible?
Tom hasn't driven in years.
He was slightly injured in a traffic accident.
Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
Do you think that's what we should do?
You're hurting me.
That plane will take off at five.
I was looking for something.
Why don't you love me?
I must offer you an apology for coming late.
This is a time of year when people get together with family and friends to observe Passover and to celebrate Easter.
I'm pretty good at math.
I'm not allowed to talk.
I couldn't tell you why.
I know Tom is a Canadian.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
My mother didn't mention it.
How is it that you can speak this language?
Tom works at a hospital near here.
How fast can you do it?
Who are you trying to convince?
What do you want me to do?
I don't think they're married.
Take my word for it.
I hope this is the right one.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
I didn't realize you were awake.
A caged cricket eats just as much as a free cricket.
Tom got the ticket for free.
They live in peace.
Does anybody here have a corkscrew?
Did the trip live up to your expectations?
I thought you'd be much fatter.
I've been watching you study.
Are you blaming me for your lack of success?
I suggest we get moving.
I almost feel sorry for you.
Do you want me to wait?
Most of us are much more interesting than the world suspects.
Tom doesn't know if Mary is dead or alive.
They stayed in the room with me for the whole night.
When did he go to Europe?
Get on your knees.
I caught my son making prank calls to random phone numbers.
Why is this happening?
What will you do with your first paycheck?
I've discovered a serious error.
Did Tom break your heart?
I have an announcement.
Leave no stone unturned.
That was really effective.
She closed her diary slowly.
I think you were right.
I'm glad you brought that up.
How do I apply for a visa?
I knew you two would like each other.
I wonder where Tom and Mary are.
I know your mother.
I don't have any problems at all.
He had to call on all his experience to carry out the plan.
I don't think anyone really knows the real me.
I hope your brother is better.
Anyone could do that.
Can you play the violin?
That's really not funny.
I didn't cry.
You are a good person.
He is wearing a hat.
He has fallen in love with me.
There's a new sheriff in town.
How does that make you feel?
He mistook me for my younger brother.
I'm getting old.
She ordered a cup of tea.
Turn up the volume.
Have you really already found a new job?
Take this medicine. You will feel better soon.
I have a piano.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Look again.
I eat alone.
I was lonely without her.
I have no choice but to eat what they serve me.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to need some help.
I didn't look at it.
Tom and Mary loved each other.
Do you remember the day when we met first?
He has a basket full of strawberries.
You're back again.
Go get changed.
He didn't get in until 2 o'clock in the morning.
That amplifier doesn't work.
That's not your fault.
Have a nice trip!
Don't lose your sense of humor.
Is he interested in me?
I work alone.
What kind of ranch did you grow up on?
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Go away!
Are you still scared?
Tom acted as if he didn't know us.
He made an abrupt departure.
What have you concluded?
I'm so happy.
He is in his library.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to go with him to Boston.
I think we've run out of gas.
He was accused of stealing money.
I've found a good job.
I don't deny having said that.
I find this difficult to believe.
You're the one who trained me.
We stayed at the Hilton Hotel.
I don't have any homework tonight.
I had to stop.
Which floor do you live on?
I need money to buy other things.
I still think this is the best choice.
They probably didn't hear you.
Are you up for it?
The team approved his proposal.
We're a family.
I remember when I was about your age.
What a bizarre idea!
I thought I'd dropped something.
You should start as early as you can.
Don't buy things on credit.
Let's go and see as many things as we can.
I wonder if Prince William lets anyone call him Bill.
I can drop you off at the airport tonight.
I know that you know this.
Where did you put my keys?
Tom said no.
The tire factory employs 250 people.
We're not in school anymore.
I can't tell you how much this means to me.
I could see it was you.
Smoking is prohibited.
The play is at eight o'clock.
I just heard something.
My mom walked into my room.
His grandfather always supported his ideas.
I lost the bet.
We know our problems.
I feel more confident now.
I'm going out for lunch.
Are you ready to party?
You aren't ready for this.
What am I supposed to do with what you gave me?
I said shut up!
They greeted each other warmly.
What did you do at school today?
I really thought I could do it.
They manage to get along without much money.
Tom told me he wasn't feeling very well.
You like everyone.
I thought it was good.
You've been a good audience.
I think you'll want to hear me out.
I didn't know I was invited.
The ship ran aground on a sandbar.
I think you should see this.
Tom is in his bedroom doing his homework.
The town is packed with tourists.
He did it all out of kindness.
I have never read that book.
I wouldn't do that without Tom.
Let's sit for five minutes.
We have an unusual relationship.
Your sister's sleeping.
I bet you didn't know that.
He looked up at the ceiling.
Why did they hire you?
Who brought the beer?
Do you want some hot chocolate?
This hotel is better than that hotel.
He should have known better.
We're done.
We need evidence.
Why are you imitating me?
Do you have some money?
We've been at this for hours.
Does that mean no?
Love doesn't exist.
I'm lazy.
I paid my bills.
Don't let Tom use my car.
Where are the other girls?
Tom stood still for a moment.
I really need to go.
We heard a gunshot.
The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear and she nodded.
I was very tired so I went to bed early.
She devoted herself to him.
She didn't even try to help.
We're back early.
We're losing it.
I think I touched a nerve.
You don't want this.
He has good eyesight.
How about running?
It's a TV.
Excuse me. Can you speak English?
I rented an apartment when I lived in Boston.
The plan was a success.
You'll never be alone.
I'm aware of my responsibilities.
This should become standard practice.
I'm homeschooled.
They saved us.
Can you do this somewhere else?
You may disagree with me.
You'll never be alone.
What did you do that for?
I'm tired of watching TV.
She lowered her standards.
I was very tired.
I've seen this before.
He tricked me.
You have a lovely daughter.
Tom is no threat.
He hopes to go abroad.
I love weddings.
Face facts!
I've always been afraid of doctors.
I dislike her unfriendly attitude.
Tom wants to be famous.
I'm proud of the work I've done here.
Do you like dogs?
What're you all dressed up for?
They were afraid of being overheard.
What did you find out?
It happened very fast.
Don't you want to be in love again?
It would take at least three hours to paint this room.
Light travels faster than sound.
He gave a loud cry for help.
I found Tom's diary.
I don't think I'm the problem.
May I use your telephone?
Tom's favorite movie is Dumbo.
I didn't know Tom would let Mary do that.
I'm beginning to get used to doing this.
Do you like rap?
He writes to me less and less often these days.
I want to learn how to snowboard.
Tom is a very violent person.
I abhor spiders.
Let's divide this money between you and me.
Tom trusts him.
Tom Jackson is my favorite writer.
It's no use.
I think we've made our point.
Do you want to do it with me?
I don't know if I have enough money.
We don't talk a lot.
Do you know this man in the picture?
Aren't you satisfied?
It'll take some time until we have enough money to buy a new tractor.
I made her a dress.
You have a decision to make.
Take a whiff.
She advised him to fasten his seat belt.
Tom has a soft voice.
He comes from England.
You should tell Tom what to do.
He decided to marry her.
I'm trying to understand it.
Tom seems to have disappeared.
He played golf every day during his vacation.
I lost my wallet on the way to school.
She looked at him angrily.
Do you want some water?
He is making preparations for a trip.
What's happened to you?
Each member has to pay a membership fee.
I let you catch me.
He thought of a good idea.
She is proud of her daughter.
Have you ever failed a class?
You can't blame him.
They were scolded by the teacher.
Will I have the pleasure of seeing you again?
What were you doing last night?
I felt tired from having worked for hours.
Let me tell you all something.
Let's talk about solar energy.
I'm sympathetic.
There's no time.
Tom is still in his uniform.
He did what he promised to do for me.
Are you going to resign?
I saw his car make a right turn.
Better safe than sorry.
No animals were shot.
Why did your T-shirt shrink?
I share his opinion.
I have something very important to tell you.
You're not a child anymore.
Take it all.
We're not sure.
You are the kind of guitarist I like to sing with.
I know that Tom did that once.
Compare your sentence with the one on the blackboard.
You must see to it that the cakes do not burn.
Bad weather prevented us from leaving.
He is to come to my house tonight.
I was shocked to see this.
This sounds like French.
That's the last straw!
The robot was so lifelike that it was creepy.
I must say I'm flattered.
I will obey.
Are you enjoying your weekend?
Where did you learn all that?
Are you absolutely sure that it was Tom you saw?
I never thought I'd ever get married.
Everything is expensive here.
I just wanted to thank you again.
He's short and fat.
They don't really care.
Tom's arm must be amputated.
The dictionary is on the desk.
The tetanus shot hurt more than the dog bite.
I'd like you to postpone your trip.
Mary is knitting Tom a scarf.
You could've ruined everything.
A rolling stone gathers no moss is a proverb.
Tom often thought about Mary.
The house is warm.
There are no comments yet.
Mary isn't like the other girls.
I'm going to study English this afternoon.
Can you give us your thoughts on that?
No mechanical problems were found.
Tom has a soft spot for Mary.
Hazelnuts are harvested in mid-autumn.
I expect him to come.
He did what I told him to do.
I don't know if I should tell him.
There is no film in this camera.
Wouldn't they be happy?
You can't give Tom that.
How long did it take Tom to build the doghouse?
We waited outside.
I'll leave that up to you.
Look at that dog.
Tom loved his children.
Tom and Mary became lifelong friends.
I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight.
Tom came by himself.
I feel like an outsider.
I'm not going to explain it to you.
I will return to Australia the day after tomorrow.
I'm just getting started.
I didn't pay attention.
We aren't always right.
They have brown skin and black hair.
We left immediately.
This laptop computer is very thin.
My friend was arrested for speeding.
You must take care of yourself.
We want to make a simple change.
I can teach you how to drive.
Where are the dishes?
I'd like you to look after my dog.
I don't get it.
I just wanted to make a gesture.
This child's mother is an announcer.
The police could not control the mob.
The article on Buddhism revived my interest in Oriental religions.
Somebody must care for the patient.
I don't usually wait for anybody.
It's hard to tell.
Is there anything you want me to buy for you?
I opened the bag.
Do you mind if I come in?
I must run.
Thanks a bunch.
Have something to drink.
We'll join you shortly.
The guards didn't see you.
That's something I can't control.
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
I asked him to leave at once.
I listened to the radio this morning.
I was right in front of you.
This is really interesting.
I'm as curious as you are.
I can't believe I ate the whole thing.
Are these for sale?
Where are they going to?
Mary is beautiful and intelligent.
He touched me.
I haven't got a chance.
Have a drink with me.
Tom has been beaten up pretty badly.
Tom says he's too tired to study.
Tom hasn't been home since October.
They hang out together all the time.
He spoke with a typical Texan drawl.
Is this fish still alive?
Can't this boat go any faster?
I don't think that we should eat this.
Write something.
He cheated on me.
I withdrew some money from the bank for my trip.
I can't tell you all my secrets.
Tom decided to give Mary everything she asked for.
I wish that were the case.
Why don't you ever cook?
Is there anyone in here?
It'll never work.
She will be here this evening.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
I really am glad you're here.
Many of the students were tired.
I can help you find a job.
This is the life that I chose.
She has a funny face.
I was thinking about getting married.
He's the one I called.
You said you were going to handle it.
I ordered you a drink.
He whipped out his sword.
The Japanese government can't cope with the problem.
I'm going to flunk.
This soup is too salty to eat.
I'm offended.
Please excuse my bad handwriting.
Am I in trouble financially?
We are staying at our uncle's.
I remember this word.
I felt so uncomfortable.
When would you like to begin?
It's just a formality.
I have no time tomorrow.
The boy who had been missing was identified by his clothes.
My parents wouldn't allow me to do that when I was younger.
Is there something you want to buy?
Stop filming.
The children are crying again.
I never look at this picture without thinking of those happy days.
Don't stand near me.
May I turn on the radio?
This is getting awkward.
They're giving a big ball at the American Embassy tonight.
That's not exactly what I had in mind.
He told the children about his adventures in Africa.
He is a soccer player.
Mary was looking for you at that time.
I agree with your opinion.
He wants the money.
I broke off the engagement.
It might not be enough.
Enjoy your weekend.
Are you seriously thinking about selling this online?
We're quite alone.
Tom was impatient and restless.
He saw the surprise on my face.
Tom expected it to cost a lot more.
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do.
He is twice as old as I am.
I don't have to say a word.
He is in touch with all kinds of people.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
I'm wasted.
That was no ordinary storm.
He promised to marry her.
You're both pretty.
I'm glad you came today.
We must stop the others.
It was a sunny day.
What's the most interesting job you've ever had?
Don't get fat.
I gazed at the sea for hours.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I beg you to help us.
I don't know what you really want.
Are you productive?
I want to see what I'm up against.
I don't want Tom to know this.
Did you like it?
I can't solve this problem. It's too difficult for me.
He examined the spare parts one after another.
This pizza is really good.
She wrapped the present in paper.
Tom gathered wood for the fire.
What a waste of time!
I like this coat. May I try it on?
Tom ordered a beer.
I don't believe you anymore.
Did you win the case?
I'm by no means angry with you.
See you tomorrow in the library.
I never wanted any of this to happen.
Everyone has stopped working.
We're done talking.
These logs are heavy.
You have my attention already.
Tom made stew for dinner.
Here's the change.
He asked me to return the money to him immediately.
We'll try to answer all those questions later.
I know that you kissed Tom.
I want a lot.
Which one will he choose?
This medication works instantly.
I gave the beggar all the money I had.
Are you going to be OK?
I'm beginning to miss my girlfriend.
I wish I were wrong.
Both Tom and Mary were fired.
I'd like to go swimming this afternoon.
Coat the chicken breast with flour.
Tom doesn't seem to understand any French.
You should know it.
Tom split up with Mary.
You have to stop drinking.
I enjoyed talking with her.
Tom isn't progressing.
Your mother died yesterday.
You're conscientious.
You were wrong after all.
Don't forget to stir the stew.
That's OK.
I had no place else to go.
God sent a sign.
I think about you all the time.
I believe in myself.
Can I help you in any way?
Playing cards is fun.
We appreciate the advice.
I'm not wearing that stupid costume.
It is a pity that he can't come.
That program is still far from perfect.
Tom never sings in public.
The old couple gave him up for lost.
Were you shot?
I'll help you as much as I can.
Are you brushing your teeth properly?
Do you want me to wait?
Where are they taking you?
The child is suffering from the heat.
I know that's not why you're here.
Who broke this window?
I expected you home an hour ago.
We should probably go.
It has a leak.
I know Tom likes to travel.
Have you ever broken a bone?
Do you remember what Tom was wearing yesterday?
Listen to me carefully.
That's a waste of time and money.
Men know nothing about women.
I have been to the airport to see my friend off.
You're going to be jealous.
There's some leftover food in the fridge.
I have nothing else to do.
What a thought!
I was afraid you'd say that.
Stop your bellyaching.
There's no point in waiting.
Write your full name.
Are you coming to the store with me?
He got down on his knees and prayed for the souls of the deceased.
You're not very good.
I don't know how you did it.
Tom is smart and funny.
Did you finish your paper?
Is that a challenge?
Do you like to be kept waiting?
It rained all night.
She plans to stay at the Oriental Hotel.
My shoelaces came undone.
How much time do you spend with your spouse?
I feel like I've become someone else.
Find a job.
The news made them happy.
I don't speak your language.
You're very shy.
Let's list all the reasons we need to do this.
Excuse me just a moment.
You know enough.
You should try doing that.
You won't be shot.
Tom drank a glass of water.
Why would somebody want to live there?
I still have the umbrella you lent me.
Are you in any of those pictures?
Let's have a drink.
Are you coming or not?
We're experienced.
I've gotten used to going to bed early.
You'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
You're young and strong.
Nobody suspected anything.
That's what we all thought.
Draw me a seven-pointed star.
That kiss was amazing.
Stop screaming in my ears.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Would you carry this down to the second floor for me?
Why did you paint the bench red?
I have a sweet tooth.
Is everything satisfactory?
Tom had no choice but to do what the boss told him to do.
I don't need this much.
Mary is my half-sister.
I really should know the answer.
I don't like your tone.
Tom stopped reading for a moment.
How do you usually decide what to eat?
I usually wash my clothes at a launderette.
It's so obvious.
Do you enjoy losing?
Tom asked for more coffee.
I lost the watch.
Please come on time.
I didn't know that you cared.
That is my own affair.
Guess what I want to talk about.
Her mother will continue to work.
He was a brave soldier.
We're worried about Grandma and Grandpa.
We need to study more.
Don't put your head out of the window.
I have no clue.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I went for a walk early in the morning.
I will try.
Am I dreaming?
She was always trying to provoke me into saying something I would regret later.
Would that make you happy?
I knew Tom was a bad driver.
It's not real money.
I'm not a criminal.
My son is small for his age.
The door opened and a man came out.
The new president was a warm and friendly man.
They did not give up hope.
I turned the lights out.
He who sleeps with dogs gets up with fleas.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm wrong.
Please show me the way to the station.
That store no longer sells cosmetics.
I'll get off here.
Should I wait for you here?
My brother-in-law is a cop.
I'm double-parked. Could you hurry it up?
She's the perfect housewife.
I want you to listen carefully.
We have a problem we need to discuss.
We all want you back.
She advised him not to eat between meals.
I'm the same height as Tom is.
Be prepared.
The roses are in bloom in our garden.
It's a rough neighborhood.
How's your project coming along?
Our team is two points ahead.
My French isn't very good.
She removed the dishes from the table.
We could read.
I can't swallow these tablets without a drink of water.
No one liked President Buchanan's message to Congress.
I have nothing more to do today.
Tom thought Mary could do it.
Where's the newspaper?
We are doomed.
Everybody has secrets.
Let's review the evidence.
Tom is watching.
I was fined a dollar.
Do your own job.
I'd prefer to only hire people to translate into their native language.
It was a ship with a crew of 25 sailors.
Don't rush.
What's the secret?
They addressed me as doctor.
Can you tell me your address?
I've been dying to see him.
That hotel was very near the lake.
He hates shopping.
What're you doing in this park?
He easily gets angry.
This house has a solid foundation.
Tom plucked up the courage to kiss her.
You're wonderful.
Astronomy is an expensive hobby.
We all wish for permanent world peace.
You'll have to ask someone else.
We had a blast.
Can I come in now?
I won't tell if you won't.
Riding double on a bicycle is dangerous.
How much did it cost us?
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
Taiwanese food is milder than Indian food.
I can hear Tom singing.
He has made me what I am today.
He has a huge ego.
The report is incorrect.
You should talk to a specialist.
Watch the prisoner.
I didn't mean to confuse him.
You want to go out for a drink?
Would you like me to teach you how to play chess?
You've got to give up gambling once and for all.
I'm on a really tight schedule this week.
My favorite fish is salmon.
Why don't you give us a moment to talk?
I thought we could get together later.
I'm not available.
Don't let Tom escape.
It feels weird.
They caught the robbers red-handed.
I attended several parties last week.
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
I have to button my jacket.
I said nothing of the sort.
Winter has gone. Spring has come.
He made up his mind to marry her.
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
Europe is not a country.
You all did well.
He cut some branches off the oak tree.
No one will change anything.
I was here first.
You need to move on.
What would your father think?
Be nice to her.
I have to convince people to do that.
He turned to his friends for help.
That's good news to me.
I wish Tom would hurry.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
I bought the novel on which the film is based.
You were my friend.
It was just a coincidence.
I only study in the library.
Hold the box with both hands.
I find him intriguing.
I felt sad.
I'd like to go to my room.
I would like to repay him for his kindness.
I take a bath every day.
Tom had two choices.
He was the last person to arrive.
You're very wise.
I explained the rule to him.
Pizza is the kind of food that fits into today's life style.
That's what I thought.
This bird can fly.
You need to stop complaining all the time about things that can't be changed.
Tom is quite capable of looking after himself.
Where's the rest of the team?
Do it again!
I can peel an apple.
You should read more.
We have a test today.
Where on earth can he have gone off to at this time of day?
I would rather stay at home than go out in the rain.
How far are you prepared to go?
Don't go out in this heat without wearing a hat.
Your sister's as beautiful as ever.
Tom ran out of matches so he couldn't light the fire.
Tom passed away last year.
That can happen.
You're everything to me.
Don't touch the stove.
Are you getting tired?
Can you see what's wrong with this picture?
The radio is too loud. Can't you turn it down a little?
Tom didn't have a brother.
Why do you want to know what we're thinking about?
Tom has a very stressful job.
Do you want to go?
Please give me the letter.
I have to start somewhere.
I can't do it right away.
We almost left.
Everybody made it to the wedding.
Don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
Tom paused to catch his breath.
I think I can do it.
I think it's about time to go.
He did not eat anything yesterday.
He made fun of our ignorance.
I love movies.
They stayed at a very expensive hotel.
I really like your paintings.
I just wish we could leave this horrible place.
I thought Tom and Mary were both dead.
You've set a bad example.
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom.
I like to feed the pigeons.
His office is convenient to the station.
He's good at telling jokes.
They can manage.
Are you really sick?
Why are you so insecure?
I've forgotten Tom's last name.
All of my children live in Boston.
We will defeat them.
Have a nice flight.
She made me cookies.
Were you with anyone?
He said the same thing over and over again.
Are they satisfied?
The police arrested everyone in the room.
You are late.
Can I rely on you?
It's close to my house.
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
I am looking forward to Christmas.
I got dealt a bad hand.
You're very busy.
What don't you want me to do?
You should be used to this by now.
I don't like to make a mistake.
Tom can do it.
What time does your plane leave?
The airplane took off on time.
I just finished cleaning the garage.
I lost my way in Boston.
Someone screamed.
I met a friend there.
Is this the first time you've had this kind of problem?
What do you want to do after you graduate?
A minute has sixty seconds.
I'd like some water.
I knew you'd say that.
You're the most handsome man I've ever seen.
Tom doesn't like sports.
Do as you like.
Give the television remote control back to me.
She asked him for some money.
Let's not go.
Tom advised Mary not to believe everything she reads on the Web.
Many museums are closed on Mondays.
I have everything under control.
You should go and have your hair cut.
She stabbed him in the back.
No one will know I'm here.
I want to make you an offer.
It's a misunderstanding.
Who does your decorating?
What do you like to eat?
Do you have a stopwatch?
I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
She is lucky.
We agreed we'd give it a shot.
I'll be back in just a second.
Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
You have to stay in shape.
You can't keep something that big a secret.
They didn't fool us.
Did you just insult me?
Do you know how dangerous that is?
I lay on my bed.
These books are ours.
I think you're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
I thought everyone knew.
He does not know how to drive a car.
He began with a joke.
I'm late for practice.
I don't disagree.
You're very intelligent.
You have to try to stay awake.
We found it.
I really feel like a beer.
Do you live here?
I've done things I'm not proud of.
I don't have time to deal with this letter. Could you deal with it?
Tom is much taller than you are.
I'm sure that I can do that.
Tom is weak.
I've come to the same conclusion.
My boss assigned the hard job to me.
How could they have done it?
How many people were present at the meeting?
I'll figure something out.
When are we going to do it?
I haven't slept for days.
It's easy to get lost.
A magnet attracts iron.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
It's going to rain soon.
I really like that car.
Let's not talk to her.
It's you who doesn't understand.
Would you mind if I smoke?
I'm as tall as Tom.
The ice was thick enough to walk on.
Do you think he will be elected president again?
She went on with the work.
She offered her seat to an old woman.
He who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
They don't know my name.
Tom knows how to repair computers.
I figured something was up.
The fire started in Tom's room.
Were you aware of this?
I think time will solve the problem.
I thought you might want to know.
Bad weather prevented them from sailing.
This is messed up.
I woke up with a headache.
This is the hospital where Tom was born.
Who gave you permission to do that?
I had a great time.
Please sign this receipt.
Some photos were printed in black and white.
What was in the oven?
Shall we order?
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I just want to be near you.
Do you ever study in the library?
Disable the alarm.
I saved you.
They're right behind me.
I heard a noise behind me.
Tom doesn't know how to milk a cow.
I'm wasting my time.
We haven't finished.
I go to the beach as often as I can.
Tom lost control of his car.
It's warmer.
Need I go on?
I didn't know anyone could move that fast.
I was just leaving home then.
We haven't yet begun to fight.
Tom stole the ring.
I'm home.
Doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
Try and stop me.
Her car broke down on the way.
My nose is too big.
I think that I was followed by someone.
Teaching young children isn't easy.
I think we've seen this movie before.
There is a small garden in front of my house.
My wife thinks I'm crazy.
It is raining hard.
They've crossed the border.
I wrote a letter yesterday.
He spends all his time extolling her virtues.
What kinds of goods do you sell in your shop?
I play in a band.
People are playing near the beach.
I asked him about the accident.
I don't often think about the past.
We saved your life.
Don't try to get up yet.
Stand up straight.
He's so cute.
Who was that who answered your phone?
She walked slowly away from me.
What was your question?
I think there's no point in trying to convince her.
We drank some wine.
I got upset.
Can I speak with Tom?
Tom knows that Mary doesn't love him anymore.
My students have been eagerly awaiting the test results.
It no longer matters.
This is so much fun.
The sea is rough.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
This book is not for sale.
Let's rest here.
I can't drive very well.
None of that actually happened.
That's my cat.
Living here isn't easy.
You must tell no one.
I don't have the slightest idea.
She ignored him almost all day.
Tom has done nothing illegal.
I thought we were going out to dinner.
This salad is really good.
He assumed that the man was hiding something from him.
Thank you for doing that for me.
Do you keep a dream journal?
What's happening?
Do you have a snow shovel?
Will you go?
She was painfully thin.
Let's not forget that Tom is only thirteen years old.
It's going to be a challenge.
Who wants you to be the boss?
I gave her all the money I had.
Tom doesn't think that Mary's performance was very good.
Have you ever been lonely?
You look very tired.
His theory is difficult to understand.
They agreed on everything.
We don't have to go.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
Do you have a bigger one?
She was hit by a car.
Can you check if the phone is out of order?
Tom put two slices of bread into the toaster and pushed down on the lever.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
He was impatient to see his daughter.
I won't be at the opening ceremony.
I love all of you.
Were you born there?
Stir the soup.
He is so careless that he often makes mistakes.
Who said that?
We want our money.
Tom was a little overweight when he was a child.
This hut is in danger of falling down.
That boy showed no fear.
Did anyone see you come in here?
I take vitamins.
I want to move to the countryside.
It looks like winter is here to stay.
They agreed to start early.
I had a tooth pulled out.
She wrote a book about the bird.
Don't give up!
You are imagining things.
I was looking forward to meeting you.
I'm a university student.
Does this book belong to you?
Nobody backed up what I said.
I'd like to look things over.
It's not time to die.
Gold is heavier than silver.
Where is the nearest police station?
He's walking around in his underwear.
The audience consisted mainly of students.
Don't worry about that now.
Tom really likes Chopin.
Are you ready now?
I know that you feel helpless.
I think you might have a drinking problem.
Why don't you have a drink?
Tom didn't show up for work yesterday.
Why don't you love me?
How did you come by this painting?
What is the book about?
Maybe we should just give up.
I've already fed the baby.
The ship lowered its gangway after docking.
I saw a spider walking on the ceiling.
Christians view human nature as inherently sinful.
How is that question germane to what we're discussing?
The meeting room is occupied at the moment.
I want to talk to you alone.
They look similar in some ways.
He wants more.
Why is it that you hate Tom so much?
How's your sister today?
Get out of the water.
I play golf every so often.
I felt very uneasy.
Don't sound so surprised. You know I can do whatever I want to do.
This is a time of rejoicing.
Did you sleep all day?
I don't like to be kept waiting.
God made the universe.
My parents were proud of me.
What're you all dressed up for?
Does he live here?
Look at the size of that thing!
You're a good man.
Do you want something to eat?
Thank you for asking me to do this.
You will have a new brother.
Let me think about it.
People will talk.
You don't know that.
I disagree with you on this.
I don't see what the fuss is about.
You can't unscramble an egg.
Have you seen all these movies?
He left the door unlocked.
They glanced at each other.
Things are only going to get worse.
I'm strong.
Here's the tricky part.
It's just an expression.
Did you hear what I said?
Do you feel sick?
What happened was horrible.
Message me online.
Tom imitated Mary.
It works.
It's only money.
Doing that won't take much time.
Do you own a gun?
Not all birds build nests.
Everything was stolen.
I waited for her for a really long time.
Look at your map.
What time did you get up this morning?
We'll always be friends.
Do you travel a lot?
Do you know a good place to have lunch?
The teacher asked me a difficult question.
Get Tom to help you.
The British had military bases along New York's Hudson River.
I love your daughter.
It's very close.
She knitted her father a sweater.
They can't be ignored.
"Where was he headed? ""He was headed north."""
Something happened.
Are you done with the paper?
How do I know if I'm wrong?
He translated the book from French into English.
Where was it that you found this key?
This sounds fishy.
Don't even talk to me.
I came to talk to you about Tom.
Come get it.
I'm staying at a hotel not far from here.
That's where the problem lies.
Where can I rent a costume?
Boston is a big city.
What did you say? Could you please say it again?
They're looking for a scapegoat.
The soup is hot.
When's that supposed to happen?
Tom grew up speaking both French and English.
Tom knocked on the front door.
Tom's lying.
Tom wasn't able to sleep on the bus.
Your English has improved a lot.
You've got to be bold!
That's a possibility.
He's painting his house.
Tom arrived safely.
How many did you get?
What should they do in this situation?
The Eiffel Tower is taller than Tour Montparnasse.
He did the reverse of what I asked.
I'll find the person who did this.
Everything in the bathroom is tiled except the ceiling.
My parent's house is comfortable.
Tie your shoe.
Don't interrupt me! Can't you see I am talking?
I understand you.
I don't think your plan will work.
Let me get that for you.
There are two slices of pizza for each person.
Nobody saw it coming.
We have to keep this secret.
I don't think I can help you.
Tom is the best drummer in Boston.
Does anybody here have a corkscrew?
I want to watch that movie again.
I was sober.
I was satisfied.
It didn't happen that way.
My neighbor is nice.
Don't touch this with your dirty hands.
Where on earth did you go last night?
How many books do you have in your bag?
He became a pianist.
This painting is attributed to Monet.
Can I sit next to you?
There are almost no books.
Tom found a place to live.
I'm digging a hole.
I've never trusted strangers.
Clear off the table.
Go and see who it is.
That's how he likes it.
I knew we'd find you.
Are they friends of yours?
What's your dad's name?
We must go now.
Should I wait for you here?
Tom left early this morning.
We need to finish what we started.
That's not for me to say.
This won't be easy.
Would you like to come over for dinner after work on Monday?
Is there something in particular that you want to watch?
Take a look at this map.
Do you know where they are?
I'll be your teacher.
I want to be certain you are who you say you are.
We're wealthy.
I told you I didn't want any coffee.
I don't have to make an appointment.
I was kidnapped.
They're broke.
I want to cook for you.
He was busy.
Can my friend sleep over tonight?
I would like to insure this package.
We have exams right after summer vacation.
I don't want to tell him.
He twisted my arm.
They decided on the date and location of their wedding.
I am happy to hear your voice.
What don't you like?
She doesn't have any enemies.
Ethics is a branch of philosophy.
Don't respond to questions marked with an X.
Tom is drunk.
Don't patronize me.
It's almost time to get started.
I don't know what it is.
His bicycle is blue.
I only wish I were able to help.
I can't refuse my grandchildren anything.
Tom told Mary that he thought John was innocent.
Who ate with you?
I noticed a change.
She isn't adequate to the task.
I'm tired of being treated like a kid.
I've worked in Boston.
Is that so terrible?
I love winning.
Let me tell you my side of the story.
Fish cannot live out of water.
We go to school to learn.
Tom knows where we live.
You were told to stay on the ship.
We talked about it last night.
I hate computers.
I'm a singer.
I made myself a cup of hot chocolate.
Who designed the White House?
Why would you want to do that?
She sent him a postcard.
It's easier to learn a new language when you are young.
I think I read that somewhere.
I have six mouths to feed.
Ask your doctor what he thinks.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain and the man soon died.
Life in prison is worse than the life of an animal.
It is sometimes difficult to make yourself understood in public.
She walked around looking for him.
Don't complain.
I can't tolerate this anymore.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
He and I are friends.
I've already found somebody to do that job.
He liked that.
He was a soldier during the war.
It is an option.
They all went to the restaurant.
He's only a couple of years younger than me.
Tom tightened the knot.
You're trustworthy.
They liked having more space for their children to play.
You're such an idiot!
I don't see how.
He is still alive.
I thought that she was pregnant.
Is this a compliment?
Do you really want to wear that?
Have you finished your meal?
I like your mirror.
Be careful with that.
I may be wrong.
I love the way Tom thinks.
A wise businessman knows how to clamp down on costs.
I'm sorry that I didn't reply to you sooner.
He is drunk.
Did you get a good look at his face?
Did you see anyone suspicious?
It snowed.
Are you going to come back?
I don't know any of the five ladies.
Tom bought Mary some expensive clothes.
He's still alive.
Read the label carefully.
Attendance is free.
What's new with you? How is your new job working out?
I didn't see who was driving.
He carried a cane.
Would you like to have children?
Hug Tom.
I am glad to help you.
I couldn't think of anything worse.
I've always wanted to learn to play the drums.
She was brushing her hair in front of a mirror.
Can you see the picture?
She was overcome with happiness.
We need to take this into account.
She gave me a fake phone number.
The Japanese economy grew by 4% last year.
Our team won the game.
I could never hurt you.
I let my friend copy my homework.
Tom has something in his hand.
Help yourself to the strawberry jam.
I'm one of your students.
We'd like to speak to you.
I don't know how to operate a spinning wheel.
He walked with a limp.
I don't want you to be upset.
Let's take the short cut.
We were trying to protect you.
He is afraid of getting lung cancer.
My grandfather passed away three years ago.
I'm very glad to see you again.
I thought you'd enjoy that.
Traffic lights work all the time.
He found the box under the table.
How will you pay your debts?
This box weighs three kilograms.
You must obey the traffic rules.
Try to keep it down.
Aren't you a psychologist?
You don't understand what's happening.
Don't leave your things behind.
She asked him where he lived.
Most of my traveling companions were nice.
I'm learning so much from you.
I used to be your age.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
I lost my flashlight.
He started to learn Spanish from the radio.
I like walking at night.
I had to call off the party.
Did you see yesterday's episode?
How often do you wash your sheets?
This area is off-limits.
That's a really good point.
Tom should've told us about this.
The museum is closed on Mondays.
It cost him ten dollars to get the ticket.
Tom sells computers.
I've been misunderstood.
You have to work faster.
Tom got what he deserved.
What's your favorite book?
Tom could do everything by himself.
Tom can't see without his glasses.
She was looking forward to playing table tennis with him.
Why don't you loosen up?
I can teach you something.
She was indignant at the way she had been treated.
I remember the day you were born very well.
Tom left a message.
Bread and milk are good foods.
I want you back.
He taught himself French.
I want my children to have dual citizenship.
You're a wonderful guy.
It's still a big risk.
I'm worried about my mother's health.
Tom is just being himself.
I left everything there.
I imagine that you went through a lot of difficulties.
Pinocchio had a long nose.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
We'll talk about that soon.
She is not ashamed of her misconduct.
I'm addicted to nicotine.
I'll do this as long as I can.
Why didn't you do anything?
I had to make a list of things I needed to do.
He married a local girl.
I slept the rest of the day.
My opinion differs from hers.
I confessed.
Could you get me some cough drops?
Tom isn't as old as I am.
I was one of the last to leave.
What do you want to see while you're here?
I thought it might be you.
What are you doing Monday?
I was half expecting this to happen.
It'll be easy.
We've only got three minutes.
Ten people were slightly injured in the accident.
I was scared to ask questions because I didn't want to look stupid.
I didn't buy them.
I don't know what to call you.
I was eating lunch when the phone rang.
This music is terrible.
Tom is making a video.
The rescue party searched for the missing passengers.
She dumped him for a younger man.
I believe in ghosts.
I'll put some coffee on.
Choose one from among these.
Do what I say.
They are jealous of our success.
You'll find out soon enough.
Everyone hesitated.
You should thank me.
Tell them who we are.
My mother tasted the milk.
He did it willingly.
I was relaxed.
Algebra is a branch of mathematics.
We swam in the sea.
World War II ended in 1945.
The mirror is very dirty.
Tell me which one to choose.
I think Tom did the best he could.
She wanted him to sing her a song.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
You're unusually quiet today.
I learned to drive a car and got a driver's license when I was eighteen.
The rain changed into snow.
I think Tom will be coming later.
Love is hard to define.
I'm not afraid of work.
Give me all the details.
Stop trying to cheer me up.
Please say hello to your parents.
I know every inch of the town.
The gardener planted a rose tree in the middle of the garden.
Why not go to the movies?
He refused to do much campaigning.
He came back from America.
He began to run.
Have pity on us!
There is a very old temple in the town.
The hill was all covered with snow.
Seize him!
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't want you to drive my car.
I do not like him either.
Do as I tell you.
Tom's plan seemed the best.
I lent her 500 dollars free of interest.
I found him lying on the bed.
What do you have against those people?
It was just a coincidence.
She is great at skiing.
Go and sit by your father.
I'm not good-looking.
I didn't know we had company.
May I ask your name?
Aim the video camera at that group.
I haven't seen you around before.
She wondered where she had lost her purse.
Thanks for your quick reply.
I wasn't allowed to sing.
He is not guilty of murder.
This smells good.
I sat behind a very tall person at the theater.
We played on the beach.
You'll strain your eyes trying to read in this light.
Spanish is spoken in many countries.
How many trees are in your orchard?
It's been three years since the accident.
It took a long time to bring him around to our point of view.
I don't know what I was expecting.
You can't ask us to do nothing.
I would love to go to the dance with you.
I know you've been trying to help.
Have you ever watched sumo wrestling?
When did you do this?
It depends on the size of the chair.
Finishing the report by tomorrow is next to impossible.
He was stoned.
Tom isn't used to city life.
How deep is it?
I've got a brand new bike.
She believes her son is still alive.
At what time did you hear the gunshot?
I'm about to go out.
I was disqualified.
People like to talk to you.
Would you please explain the rules to me?
There's no need to speak so loud.
Who knows what you'll find up in the attic?
I don't want to drink anything cold.
His room is untidy.
I have your schedule here.
You must be kidding!
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a wedding dress.
I'm not sure that you're ready.
I really like that guy.
Whose kid is that?
Whose phone number is this?
Tom certainly wasn't at home when we went to visit him.
There are more girls than boys in this school.
Are you sure you're not imagining things?
You might not want to mention that.
I want to know who sent you.
You may choose any of them.
He'll be back in a few minutes.
What do you like about her?
They didn't find the bomb.
I can't eat meat.
Can this be true?
The talk was peppered with scientific jargon that no one understood.
The news of her sudden death came like a bolt from the blue.
This is the book I want to read.
There are still people who believe the earth is flat.
Nobody noticed her absence.
You need to press the button.
I knew you were against it.
It is me that is wrong.
Mine is the red one.
No man is wise at all times.
He turned off the light and he went to bed.
The students walked in a single file.
His record is a new world record in the 100-meter dash.
This music makes me sick.
This word comes from Latin.
You should've come a little earlier.
When will it begin?
They smiled.
I couldn't do that today.
This is my first time in Boston.
You found something they didn't.
Hand over your weapons.
Is the Orient too foreign for you?
I had a good summer vacation.
Might I express my opinion?
I don't want to throw that away.
We all learn by experience.
Is this all of them?
I'm addicted.
We have ants in the kitchen. We need to call an exterminator.
I don't remember that conversation.
I will choose one.
The two ladies smiled at each other.
You're spending too much time on the computer.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
We ran out of money.
Are you looking for someone?
Everybody has to do that.
They lived in Spain for several years.
No one spoke.
I lied to protect you.
We shouldn't leave anything to chance.
Tom was shot in the head.
I can't believe he kissed you.
Tom poured more coffee for himself.
The room was dark.
I want my life back.
I can do it faster on my own.
I don't think it's necessary to do that.
You are very rich.
It's not impossible.
You look nervous.
How much do I owe you?
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
Make another appointment at the front desk.
You need an ambulance.
You need to set the record straight once and for all.
It could be a trap.
Is there an information counter?
I can't tell you what we did last night.
Tom started shaking uncontrollably.
He ran away when he saw the policeman.
He has a book.
Come home at once.
Do you really want to do that today?
I don't think he's playing with a full deck.
What's all the fuss about?
Close the box.
How is your daughter?
His face turned white.
I can't say I'm shocked.
What she lacks in charisma she makes up for with hard work.
I'm waiting for a phone call.
It was a coincidence.
Tom waited for Mary for three hours.
I wrote some postcards to my friends.
I really like your music.
They don't like you.
My car won't start.
Thank you in advance for your help.
That boy is very clever.
Put that stuff back in the box.
I will go at 10.
Is this a pen or a pencil?
The explorers ventured inside the caverns.
I'm not busy right now.
He didn't carry out his promise.
What's your beef?
Is this fish still alive?
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
We were both a bit drunk.
Everyone was surprised.
Many thanks.
I'm freaking out.
You've got a big mouth.
I don't like homework.
All of her songs became hits.
That's all we're offering.
Act like a man.
She came to like the new teacher.
I eat there every night.
They should've known that this would happen.
Does she have a boyfriend?
It's stopped snowing.
I let you catch me.
It looked awful.
You should refrain from smoking.
This bucket leaks.
Tom stinks.
She has a small black dog.
The school was established in 1650.
We discussed the problem far into the night.
Where did you find this?
You're in luck. The plane is on time.
Why don't you say something?
You're the last person I expected to see here.
They're after you.
I am not like you.
Tie your shoes.
You promised me that you would take care of them.
He is absent from school.
Aren't you going to say something?
Tom isn't as talkative as he used to be.
I promised not to tell.
When did you quit smoking?
How is it that you're always so full of energy?
I hope not.
Try to resist.
The police demanded that the criminal hand over the gun to them.
Tell me what really happened.
What'll become of me?
I thought you'd be older.
Few students understand Latin.
When did all this start?
I hope everything is okay.
He was sentenced to death.
It's not easy raising children.
I hate it when Tom and Mary fight.
The soldier was wounded in the leg.
This is a dead-end alley.
It's possible that he came here when he was young.
Don't just stand there.
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars.
I want to hear from you.
Tom waited his turn.
I'm inviting you.
Juggling is actually a lot easier than it looks.
Tom asked Mary to read the letter.
That isn't a cat.
Tom has suffered some failures.
I need more time to make up my mind.
We went to the park to take pictures.
Tom doesn't wear glasses.
The cake is ready.
I don't know either of his brothers.
Let's dispense with formalities.
We went into the red last year.
I was sitting behind Tom.
Don't you think we should call the police?
Interest rates are going up.
You don't even know how.
I should go.
I want you to help me clean it up.
Tom said we can stay.
That was the idea.
I know Tom knows something.
I signed the form.
I wasn't sure what to do.
Is there anything to eat?
How did you kill the guards?
Can you speak French well?
You're such a tattletale.
Don't do that.
I always win.
I figured that you wouldn't come.
He is concerned about his parent's health.
A new oil tanker was launched.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
You must put an end to this foolish behavior.
Show me where it happened.
What did I ever do to you?
That's acceptable.
We aren't as busy as Tom.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
A lot of time was wasted.
He had the table to himself.
I couldn't keep from snickering.
The situation is getting worse every day.
I will watch it.
I was a student at that time.
The magician asked for a volunteer from the audience.
I sneeze a lot.
I know everybody's name.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom wasn't allowed to drive.
How curious!
There is some wind.
That book is theirs.
You're the best.
You're too old for me.
Do you know anyone who hums while they work?
He demanded that his salary be increased.
Why would I need to do that?
Oil has played an important part in the progress of civilization.
Would you consider marrying me?
Take everything.
I heard Tom is filing for divorce.
Someone left the water running.
I know who didn't do what they were supposed to do.
Are you here to help us?
You look very tired.
Who called you?
Do you write in French?
The heater doesn't work.
Life is full of surprises.
I like their pictures.
It is unfair.
He has a Japanese car.
Tom has decided to become a pilot.
Tom dozed off in French class.
I knew I'd find you here.
Tom couldn't tell what the problem was.
Ask him when the next plane will be.
We waited.
I really need a hug.
Contact me for more information.
I had to see you.
She advised him to go abroad while he was still young.
I was trapped in a vicious circle.
Tom is pretty sure everything will go well.
What's the matter with you?
She really is a miserable girl.
I wouldn't want to miss your concert.
I think it's time for me to spend a little time with my children.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
The plan has been successful so far.
My father owns a small business in Fukuoka.
I hear that Tom really speaks French well.
Why not join us for lunch?
How was your test?
We all worked really hard.
Where are you calling from?
I can't stay home today.
You aren't Tom.
What do you do on Sundays?
He is equal to the job.
Tom never really trusted Mary.
He denied having met her.
What's all this noise?
We walked ten miles that day.
I've never seen so many trees in my life.
I caught a glimpse of him in the crowd.
Do you want some pepper?
He had no money.
Who told you to bring me here?
There is a traffic jam on the highway.
Someone's going to hurt Tom.
My sister has a piano.
What's your favorite pizza topping?
I'm not hitting on you.
You must learn from your mistakes.
I saw tears in his eyes.
Where are you headed for?
I have cash.
Where are my slippers?
They guarantee this clock for a year.
Dogs aren't allowed in this hotel.
I'm glad to be home.
Let's talk about your family.
Was it complicated?
I used my imagination.
I don't know what you're waiting for.
My job is boring.
Have you considered that?
Do you really want to win?
I've always liked that name.
Tom looks proud of his son.
I'm assuming this is your father.
I thought about what you said yesterday.
How many men do you have?
You can come in.
I thought that was your job.
How many times a week do you eat out?
How many books have you read?
Tom wants to go to Australia.
I'd like to ask you about how to do that.
I hope he sees this.
I can't believe this happened.
I'm not a kid.
Tom wants Mary to know he's not planning on asking her to marry him.
Any child can answer that.
I rushed out to see what was going on.
The doctor told Tom to stop eating dog food.
Did you mention my book?
These plates aren't clean.
Who took my keys?
She scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush.
Tom went with Mary to Boston.
You shouldn't eat that.
They study in the afternoon.
He succeeded in business.
You can't do two things at once.
I love hanging out with you.
We get together once a year.
It seems logical to me.
I feel like I'm wasting my time.
He let the dog loose in the garden.
I have to put the kids to bed.
I want the two of you to quit arguing.
I've asked you repeatedly to do that.
That's stupid.
Tom promised us his support.
It is hard for me to believe this.
The train will probably arrive at the station before noon.
She sent him a message.
Tom ate the rest of the pizza.
I sat down next to him.
I totally freaked out.
Very little is known about them.
Did the umbrella that you found belong to Tom?
Do I have your permission to do so?
This makes me very happy.
That's why I came.
What are you waiting for?
You're shivering. Are you cold?
She bought him a camera.
You're so sweet.
I probably shouldn't have eaten that.
I've decided to do that by myself.
I'd like to help you.
She's promised to give me a ring.
Tom said he'd do that in a couple of days.
I've already made amends to most of the people on my list.
Why did you go over my head on this?
He is working hard in order to pass the entrance examination.
Can I see you in my office?
Let's open a bottle of wine.
Don't let people take advantage of you.
Every student who has graduated from our university has studied English with a native speaker for at least two years.
And then something amazing happened.
Few people live to be more than a hundred.
The library is upstairs.
This is the house where I lived when I was a child.
I've seen a lot of him recently.
I think my German isn't very good.
Do you really love me?
This school was founded in 1650.
It is going to be quite cool.
I have little money now.
This is cool.
I want to buy my bike back.
You talk too much.
They disappeared.
Both of them seem suspicious.
I've been upset not having written you a reply.
Buying a new TV won't make you happy.
You promised me that you would help.
Tom will probably hurt you.
What's in those boxes?
Tom lost his balance.
The frost did a lot of damage to the crops.
I've got a good idea.
My brother is rich.
My home is your home.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
Washing dishes is something I don't really enjoy doing.
I can't believe everything that just happened.
These books are mine.
He's a comedian.
Let's drink to our charming hostess!
Tom was almost three hours late.
I really liked that.
I bought her a new car.
I thought hard.
Tom looks older than he really is.
Why are you so hard-headed?
The whale is the largest animal on the earth.
Are you home?
Who told you to say that to me?
I'm not the one you should be scared of.
More than twenty boys went there.
Be polite to everyone.
English is spoken in America.
When did you find out that Tom didn't have to do that?
I'm pleasantly surprised by that.
I didn't know that woman at all.
Were you out last night?
This may change next year.
I need an envelope.
We have to do this together.
The twins are as alike as two peas in a pod.
Tom doesn't want to take a walk now.
She is forbidden to go out.
The hotel was burned down.
I'm going to do it first thing tomorrow.
I couldn't get another copy of the book.
She called him to say that she'd be late.
I can do that in less than ten minutes.
I didn't hear you come in.
Why did you agree to help them?
I am not pleased with what you have done.
He was absent at roll call.
You should keep your promise.
Let's not forget we never could have done this without Tom's help.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
I have lived here for a long time.
I found it.
Maybe I should go with you.
Tom didn't have a lot to say.
How can you not remember?
I want to go to the movies.
Those were the days.
He died yesterday.
Is French your native language?
He commutes to his office by bus.
School starts in September in Europe.
I hope it will change.
I'm still your friend.
I'm staying.
Can you read Arabic?
I want to know how you feel about this.
Do you have any small change?
Do you know what time they came?
We're conscientious.
The leaves fell.
He is not ashamed of his father being poor.
Did you sleep enough last night?
Are you certain that's what you want?
Finally she gave in to temptation and ate the whole cake.
He sacrificed his health to fulfill his duty.
Come over here and sit down.
You can sit wherever you like.
I will miss you.
This is acceptable.
Are you ready to leave?
Kiss me.
Do you see the raccoon?
My son thinks women are stronger than men.
I hope they appreciate it.
Do you want me to send you money?
Whose turn is it to buy donuts?
My children don't listen to me.
You don't seem tired at all.
Tom has the experience necessary.
Tom failed to come on time.
It's the wrong one.
Will you show me your album?
I want to go abroad next year.
There is no way of knowing where he's gone.
I want to see you first.
You are a teacher.
How come you're not the boss?
This computer's a lot faster than my old one.
She kept working.
What's your phone number?
They burned.
It was Tom who told me you were sick.
Tom built a raft.
Are you here alone?
I will hit the sack.
You pay me very well.
You owe me big time.
I'm a total wreck.
Tom knew he'd done something wrong.
I don't trust you at all.
Have you tried Japanese beer?
Tom knows how to win.
I think you did that intentionally.
We arrived three days ago.
I'm not a very good artist.
He was drunk and angry.
Are you still scared?
I'm glad you invited me to your party.
I don't wear glasses.
How did I get here?
Weve been waiting for hours.
You're good.
He speaks Chinese.
I was almost hit by a car.
She advised him to see a lawyer.
He faked his death and assumed a new identity.
It's an emergency!
Don't write in library books.
We were outnumbered.
The baby was naked.
I gather you were hurt.
I still do that.
I have a request.
I'm a university student.
Let me help you.
I want to stay here longer.
She admits knowing the secret.
Tom is boring.
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be.
Whoever thought of this stupid plan should be fired.
She couldn't take her eyes off him.
This city is famous for its beautiful park.
I couldn't stand looking at it.
What foods are you allergic to?
You really should've told Tom not to come.
I don't know what he'll do.
I agree with you absolutely.
How many bags do you have?
Who caught this fish?
I woke you up.
I'm waiting for my mother.
We depend on foreign nations for our natural resources.
I know someone who can help you.
I don't trust talkative people.
He checked the calculations again just to make sure.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
Tom seems to know all that already.
Nobody is paying attention to Tom.
Do you know how to ride a horse?
You're out of touch with reality.
I'm no longer a rookie.
My father knows your mother very well.
It feels like an orange.
Are you listening?
Why did Tom call?
iTunes has turned out to be a real cash cow for Apple.
You're worse than Tom.
When is it going to end?
I didn't expect you so soon.
Have a nice time.
I'm hungry!
She was looking forward to seeing him again.
I don't play tennis after school.
Isn't there something you want to say to Tom?
I go to the barber's once a month.
We were partners.
He works at a tattoo parlor.
I got off lightly.
That made me very sad.
I felt as if I had no choice.
What did you buy it for?
I couldn't have done it better myself.
Everyone started clapping.
He said that it was nine o'clock.
Are you smiling?
Is there a particular way I'm supposed to address you?
They found us.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
Columbus believed that the earth was round.
This is by far the best way.
I was confronted with many difficulties.
Did I say something wrong?
You are my best friend.
Read as many books as possible.
Are you registered?
Your computer will restart several times during installation.
I gave you fair warning.
Did I wake you up?
There was a lot of snow.
That's foolish.
They're very smart.
She is anxious about her safety.
They're all on vacation.
No one agreed with me.
You need a key to open the box.
She promised not to tell anyone.
I've never spoken to anyone in French.
Science can be used for good or evil purposes.
He speaks as if he were an expert.
My brother would often stay up all night reading novels.
I didn't want you to leave me.
Don't talk about work. We're on vacation.
Who's hiding behind the curtain?
Whose son are you?
Either he is wrong or I am.
The books are on the bench.
It's good to see that our efforts were not in vain.
I'm not able to fix the computer.
This book is easy enough for them to read.
I wouldn't have worried about that.
She doesn't have a driver's license.
He should have worked harder.
Get on your feet.
I think we should head back.
I ate a donut.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
He talks as though he knew everything.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
He sent me a present.
You'd better be careful what you say.
She gave him a sweater.
I'd like something to eat.
I feel like vomiting.
You've failed.
They say that he hates to study.
I'm sick of English.
My mother has gone shopping.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
Several plans were proposed.
Can the dentist see me today?
Loneliness and being alone are not the same thing.
She ran as fast as possible.
I'm game.
Was I not supposed to eat yet?
My sister will get married early next year.
Doing that would be a waste of time.
These are bad times.
I don't see any footprints anywhere.
My watch loses three minutes a day.
How did you become involved in this project?
I didn't mean to scare you.
Did he say anything about it to you?
Try doing that once more.
Who am I addressing?
This doesn't fit.
Slavery in the United States was not abolished until 1865.
You know I hate that.
Can you see that small house?
Maybe you and I should do something.
Tom tried to be polite.
It's not about them.
I'm dieting.
Where would you like to go?
A face appeared at the window.
I'm at the beach.
You're not helping much.
What natural foods help curb the appetite?
He who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing.
You know who I mean.
There are many wild animals around here.
The Eiffel Tower is in the same city as the Louvre Museum.
This medicine has no harmful side effects.
I should've been honest with you.
I don't like it when you do that.
We're partners.
The world is full of fools.
She is about my age.
He is an authority on China.
I spent all afternoon shopping.
Some children play video games all the time.
I'm making progress.
Where can I find toothpaste?
Is there anyone else around?
The computer is to her left.
I wonder what happened.
Give me a break.
They were very excited.
These shoes cost too much.
I want to take a walk.
I'm writing a novel.
Tom stole my camera.
I need to go there.
Are you finished reading the newspaper?
I met a man from Boston this afternoon.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
I won't forget.
Tom has to act now.
She did it on purpose.
Make yourself presentable.
It's not like that.
I carried the box on my shoulder.
That doesn't cut the mustard.
You can't just make up the rules as you go along.
Hand in your papers.
I believe you'll get over it soon.
How do you talk to women?
I want you to come back early.
There's nothing you can do to stop me.
I'd be happy if that happened again.
I can assure you everything is under control.
Human remains were found during the excavation.
Don't write in ink.
He's always complaining about the food.
He is worthy to be captain of our team.
I just want to say thanks to you all.
I don't want you to see me naked.
I've just spoken to your French teacher and he says you're doing well in his class.
Tom won't be long.
Is that what you really want?
I have something for you to do.
She blushed.
The road curves gently towards the west.
I'm going to try.
I shouldn't have interfered.
The police say they know you had an accomplice.
I know Tom is finished.
Tom called back.
You're the best singer I know.
What are you doing at school this afternoon?
There's a cold wind today.
I've read both these books.
Are you coming with us?
Tom doesn't think that is a good idea.
I want my job back.
His father was a policeman.
These trousers are dirty.
I left my calculator on my desk.
You've only been here for three weeks.
We all know Tom is guilty.
Divide this among yourselves.
We have five days to go before the summer vacation.
I'm shorter than you.
The explorers made their way through the jungle.
Did you go to your dance class this afternoon?
Will you show me your photo album?
Tom didn't tell me this.
You should be more careful at a crosswalk.
See what happens when you give people advice?
She's a bit naive.
I want to help you get out of this mess.
That would be weird.
I don't even have one.
How do you know for sure?
They fought the measures in the courts.
He gave me what little money he had.
It's fun.
Let me get my wallet.
I know where he lives.
We hope to do a good job.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
I've come to ask you a favor.
The trees are already bare.
I feel worse today than I did yesterday.
Why did you shoot me?
Do you want a cold beer?
He's a hunk.
Never forget to lock the door.
I have got to go now.
What has he done to you?
Would you excuse me a second?
I didn't mean to surprise you.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Tom will use force.
Are you guys armed?
That's just a guess.
It is doubtful whether this method will work.
Tokyo is a very expensive place to live.
Do you want to play hide and seek?
Is that a riddle?
Have you fed the dog?
I can't be sure.
Her eyes filled with tears.
He told his son an interesting story.
She talks a lot.
They can't get out.
Tom is a famous singer.
The young worker was asked to resign.
I don't think I need your help today.
I wasn't ready for this.
I mistook him for his brother.
I spilled my coffee on the carpet.
We lost.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
You're not telling me the whole truth.
It's Christmas.
Did I give you that impression?
I'm using that cup.
Tom could help you.
I'm still here.
I thought your house was downtown.
I dozed on a park bench.
Tom's way of speaking got on my nerves.
Who is your lawyer?
I promise you I won't do anything to harm you.
That's my teacher.
We had less snow this winter than we had expected.
Tom looked really uncomfortable.
I don't mind if it's hot.
You're very emotional.
It's too difficult.
We do not accept gratuities.
You have no choice.
Tom is looking for his phone.
How serious is the problem?
He donated a lot of money.
I figured you'd be impressed.
You should look this word up.
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Too much is at stake.
They're not a threat.
The number of students in this class is limited to 15.
They decided to settle in a suburb of London.
You should take your car to Tom's Garage. He does a pretty good job.
Did you hear the news?
I have to stop.
You're kind of cute when you're mad.
She informed me of her departure.
He got wonderful results.
Can you take me with you on the plane?
She climbed down from the roof.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
Honesty is no guarantee of success.
This is a story about a cat.
Tom is older than his sister.
You can't give up now.
I'd like to go abroad someday.
I made these.
Who is your favorite pianist?
I gather you were hurt.
I apologized profusely.
Could I talk to you in private?
I'm not old enough.
Please help yourself to the cake.
He's three years older than her.
Salmon can jump up to 12 feet high.
I really can't deal with that right now.
What does this stand for?
We have to do something to stop this from happening again.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
Tom committed suicide by hanging himself.
Tom looked Mary in the eye.
How did you spend your vacation?
Is it a direct flight?
You're very wise.
That guy has a screw loose!
It looks good on you.
Speak when you are spoken to.
I have already eaten lunch.
He might not be happy.
I have no will power when it comes to exercising.
I'm a native French speaker.
I am the chosen one.
He barely passed the examination.
Would you like to talk about what just happened?
They don't know us.
It is difficult to prove that ghosts exist.
It's pretty cold.
I'll try to find them for you.
A calamity was avoided by sheer luck.
Tom plays the bass guitar in our band.
Are you still not convinced?
The house has been empty for years.
I really miss you all.
I'm really not very good at French.
Have you taken your medicine yet?
They greeted each other warmly.
It's my custom to go for a walk before breakfast.
Bring me my cane.
It didn't work out.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
What's not to like?
I spend at least three hours a week studying French.
Are those the people you saw yesterday?
Do you know where Tom is going?
Roses smell sweet.
I know that you know.
They're downstairs.
I had an amazing experience.
Can I take a selfie with you?
Halloween was originally a Celtic festival.
Do you shower every day?
I'm sorry about my mistake.
We had a wonderful weekend.
Don't blame me for this.
Tom carefully opened the box.
How much am I paying you?
What's wrong with you?
I appreciate you taking the time to help.
I hate this music.
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.
I know it hurts.
I'm right in the middle of doing something.
Everybody made contributions.
Am I overreacting?
I like sauerkraut.
I recognized the name.
Why are dogs easier to train than cats?
You really are hopeless.
We have ample time to catch our train.
He is eating.
Mary wants to marry a millionaire.
How far are you prepared to go?
Dead men tell no tales.
What's your favorite kind of fish?
What's that scar from?
She tried on a new dress.
Tom finished washing the dishes.
I quit my job.
I don't want to dance.
I'd like to do this some other time.
That comes in handy.
I'm not your friend.
People like him because he is kind.
I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
It's you who've acted inappropriately.
Tom is not as fat as I am.
This seat's free.
Something bit me.
How many times have you been there?
I do remember the incident quite well.
Have you read today's paper?
I'm going downtown.
She was deceived by a friend.
I really thought I'd win.
I must remember to see her.
Parents need a lot of patience.
I thought I made that clear.
The climate here is very similar to that of England.
You look strong.
I didn't know you were unhappy.
Don't let it scare you.
Your services are no longer required.
Would you like to see my new car?
You sound really angry.
I didn't want to tell you this.
Tom is talking to Mary now.
I may be too old.
We don't want to lose you.
That bed is very comfortable.
I was born and brought up in Tokyo.
Can't you see I'm busy?
I still think it's unlikely that he'll come today.
That was nice.
I had a good time playing golf.
Mr. Jackson is a very good teacher.
Tom will be here in fifteen minutes.
Your shipment should be delivered within twenty four hours.
I trust we understand each other.
He didn't tell me his name.
Do you think I'm pretty?
I think we should all go inside.
I have breakfast at seven every morning.
I gave it back.
This coffee tastes bitter.
He put up a notice about the change in price.
You're lucky to have such a good job.
I've been sober for three years.
I want to go right now.
I strongly suggest that you study harder.
Tom is married to Mary.
You aren't permitted to bring dogs into this building.
I've got to pack for the trip.
Tom's distracted.
He's certain to succeed.
Are you working?
How is your new class?
It didn't happen that way.
I spent the whole evening reading the poetry of Kenji Miyazawa.
That's all it takes.
Tom and Mary mailed wedding invitations to all of their friends.
Our bike tour of the French Alps lasted two weeks.
She was falsely accused.
What do you call that?
Everyone is going to call me a liar.
I was careful not to say anything to make him angry.
Somebody touched me.
You will get the worst beating of your life.
You don't have to apologize.
We brought it with us.
You were nodding off at times during my lecture.
The baby kept quiet.
Anybody will do.
I'm sorry about last night.
We walked along the beach.
Tom is older than Mary.
They're able students.
Why are you dressed like that?
They were forecasting rain for today.
I'm cold. May I close the window?
The rumors were true.
He is a simple man.
The hikers were all but frozen when they were found.
Everyone agreed.
I'm listening to country music.
I'd love to hold you in my arms.
Don't bother me with such trifles.
He finally met my demands.
It's so good to finally meet you.
It was difficult for us to decide which one to buy.
Get your gear.
My brother gets up every morning at 7.
Did you go out?
I love spending time with you.
Will it take long to recover?
Why didn't it work?
There were no knives.
I think what you just told me was a lie.
Could you be more specific?
You're the only one who understands me.
They gave up.
What would cause that?
You smell terrible.
Does anybody know him?
I just ignore Tom.
We traveled around the world last year.
Who do you think she lives with?
We talked on the telephone.
Tom took another bite.
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.
I'm a respectable businessman.
He was in the right place at the right time.
I doubt that's what really happened.
He dedicated his whole life to helping poor people.
You need to see a doctor.
I didn't want you to read that.
The plan has worked well.
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
I've already rescheduled my appointment twice.
There's really nothing else to say.
I could tutor you.
What're you doing today?
Is she your mother?
I'm not convinced.
I hope you're having fun.
He rang me up at midnight.
I think it's a dumb theory.
You are so childish sometimes.
Don't forget to remind me of that.
We had to postpone the gathering because of rain.
He is working in the field of biology.
I can walk to school in ten minutes.
I didn't like my teacher.
There's not a big difference.
I'm not very likely to be fired for doing that.
There's something I want to discuss with you.
Don't you think this hat looks good on me?
Why is this website taking so long to load?
Are you lazy or just incompetent?
Would you like go out for a drink after work?
I suggest that you proceed very carefully.
Do you work on Mondays?
Luck is against me.
Tom got up from the table and walked into the kitchen.
She helped the old man cross the road.
I'm sorry I did that.
What did they hit you with?
The cap is too small for me.
You're going to turn a lot of heads with that dress.
God knows that it is true.
I don't think that's enough.
I was really hurt by what you said.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I was acquitted.
I'm not in a position to give you advice.
This TV doesn't come with an HDMI cable.
Bring your sister next time.
I don't want a gun in my house.
I had a feeling you would be late.
The child is dirty.
I don't want you to tell this to anybody.
Get up.
I know exactly how you feel.
I need somebody to talk to.
I don't have time to waste.
You don't seem to be as organized as Tom seems to be.
I may outlive you.
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
This soup needs more salt.
It's a mushroom.
Do you want me to shuffle the cards?
Are you new here?
No rain is expected.
Napoleon marched his armies into Russia.
I want you to win.
My mother cleans the room.
She spends over a third of her time doing paperwork.
I know that I was wrong.
She kissed my cheek.
I'm not your daughter.
Her hair is long and beautiful.
I've loved you since I first met you.
You screwed up.
I'm very concerned about her illness.
They didn't hurt me.
The door opened automatically.
They can't do that.
I love that commercial.
I caught the man stealing the money.
I don't want my mother to worry.
I left a note.
You look surprised.
The complaint was dismissed.
I don't think we should go outside today.
I like sashimi.
I couldn't wait to get started.
I didn't know you weren't Canadian.
She wasn't able to meet him.
Tom isn't the right man for you.
All the cherry trees in the park are in full bloom.
I think we'd better be going.
I have been to the barber's.
It wasn't that big.
I appreciate the support.
I fought back.
Is there a bank near here?
His comments about the book were favorable.
Do you know what day it is today?
A burglar made away with my wife's diamond ring.
This dress fits me perfectly.
Hay is for horses.
What is your ultimate goal in your life?
Tom did a fantastic job today.
Let's make a phone call.
They deported Tom.
I thought Tom was mistaken.
I need some cardboard boxes to pack my possessions.
She rode a camel.
Are you in love?
She showed him several books that were on the shelf.
This movie is a masterpiece.
I'd appreciate that.
Tom denied having met Mary.
It is not worth the trouble.
He scratched his head.
I'd lock my doors if I were you.
Do you know who lives in that house?
The station is to the west of the hotel.
I'll give you a second chance.
I know Tom isn't a wise man.
We are about to sit down to dinner.
I feel his pain.
Tom said he found his keys.
Tom will be here by evening.
Did you get enough sleep last night?
He's their only child.
He entered the Democratic Party but soon left it.
We considered that.
Tom knows how to dive.
I had to act at once.
I gave you fair warning.
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
This sounds interesting.
I was caught in the rain on my way home.
He was able to read the book.
I've never seen you so happy.
Press any key to continue.
Are you seriously thinking about buying that old car?
I don't know what else I could've done.
I saw the car hit a man.
How can you be sure of that?
Any of you can do it.
Do you believe in God?
We're not throwing it away.
Everybody loves a winner.
It's not going to end well.
I let you down.
Did I do something wrong?
Don't you miss your father?
He lost almost all the stamps he had collected.
You should've seen what Tom did.
Where can I leave my bike?
It was an uphill struggle.
It's not all that uncommon.
What makes you smile?
Tom looks awfully busy today.
I'm not sure why they asked me that.
I still do that every day.
The solution was obvious.
I want to see you laugh.
You can't trust Tom.
It must be so hard for you.
He succeeded on his second try.
I'd like you to itemize the charges.
I'm unable to do this.
I had to see you again.
I didn't feel like going.
Are you still upset about what happened?
I think we need more water.
It wasn't as expensive as I expected.
You're all happy.
The floor must be kept clean.
I hope that it'll work.
We usually sleep in this room.
You're all alone.
This is a public beach.
My neighbor was arrested last night.
Do you honestly believe that?
Everybody got off the bus.
She started from the summit.
Tom said he wanted to dye his hair black.
We still don't know the truth.
I bought this book the other day.
I wrote it.
You don't have to go there.
You're a good mother.
I have a friend whose wife is a pianist.
He said he would call tomorrow.
Tom knew that he wouldn't be able to finish the report by 2:30.
He is making cookies.
There is something I must know.
We know it was you that broke the window.
Just give me a little privacy.
You've been warned.
I want a jump rope with wooden handles.
Do you feel any better today?
I'm sure things will work out.
You'll never escape that way.
It is threatening to rain.
He became ever more famous as a critic.
Let's take it step by step.
All of us stared at her.
I'd be delighted to sing for you.
You can't blame me.
Don't make me say it.
He's drunk.
I think you've done enough.
I don't care who you are.
I have to wait.
I thought that that would be a great idea.
He once had a lot of land.
You mean a lot to me.
Tom got stuck.
I think we all know what's happening.
Tom doesn't know if Mary will go with him tomorrow or not.
That was quite a speech.
You have a habit of exaggerating everything.
You don't owe anybody anything.
Tom doesn't like women who wear way too much make up.
No one is going to harm you.
We have to tell them something.
Coastal cities will take the brunt of the storm.
Can I pay by credit card?
I'll be ready in two minutes.
I wanted to watch you die.
I received her letter yesterday.
Should I see a specialist?
I added your name to the list.
I have enough money to buy it.
We can handle that.
He looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
I made a list of things I needed to do.
Quit acting like a baby.
Do you like it?
I don't care what he does.
It's written in black and white.
I didn't know something like this could happen.
What do you want to talk to me about?
Are you implying something?
Your parents are expecting your call.
I want to be safe.
May I have a look at that?
Do you have enough energy?
I have doubts about the success of their plan.
The girl had a large red hat on.
They'll be ready for that.
How did you learn to dance so well?
You are hilarious.
Why do you always have to get involved?
Let's go on to the next subject.
I've got a bad hangover.
It's genuine.
I don't regret what I did.
We have two ears.
I went there for the express purpose of earning money.
I won't tell you my address.
Tom is allergic to peanuts.
Let's see if we can help you.
We sat on the grass.
I want a few more minutes.
Do you feel like resting?
Tom is a very good farmer.
Are you sure it's impossible?
These are my students.
I want something hot to drink.
I don't know what this symbol stands for.
No one said anything about that.
Have you gone nuts?
The storm developed into a typhoon.
You shouldn't have to wait long.
She gave in to the temptation.
She didn't want him to leave the room.
I disposed of my old coat.
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me.
Tom is obviously very brave.
Did you enjoy yourself?
She wanted to be alone.
There are too many people in the park.
Tom goes to school.
You look familiar. Do I know you?
All are welcomed.
He's incredibly talented.
Why weren't we told the truth?
I'll make you a new suit.
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
I'm looking for a hat to match a brown dress.
How did we not see it?
I always carry a bottle of mineral water with me.
I wasn't told that.
Turn to the left.
My nose was very runny.
You should write a novel.
You're too hard on yourself.
He can run fast.
I am only warming up now.
Do I have to stay in the hospital?
That restaurant is too expensive for me.
When am I supposed to do that?
I don't know why I keep doing that.
You're conceited.
I like winter.
How far can you stick your finger up your nose?
They kissed each other.
It was Tom that saved the girl.
I need you right now.
You'd have done the same.
It's about time.
She failed in her attempt to swim the Channel.
"You're a good guitarist. ""I'd like to think I am."""
You must do it at once.
I'd like to thank you for coming today.
What's today's date?
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
You almost died.
You're very good.
I've never had this problem before.
I wish you good luck.
What's wrong with that?
That's not all that happened.
Would you like to leave a message for him?
You should stay with me.
A lot can happen in a year.
I want my money returned immediately.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
They forgot to wake me up.
Do you have a dictionary?
He is my teacher.
Have you ever tried it?
Tom is a fairly good swimmer.
I hope nothing goes wrong.
You have chosen the best.
Is it necessary for me to attend the party?
Tom agrees with what you say.
Could I change rooms?
I've never seen such a large whale.
I hope it stops raining.
Did you talk to Tom yesterday?
You may use my new car.
I don't like to inhale someone's smoke while I'm working.
I looked at myself in the mirror.
Tom is at his parents' house.
Are you angry?
I doubt if it'll snow.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
That movie was a real tearjerker.
I took my shoes off.
We can't let this continue.
I didn't write anything.
Employees are prohibited from watching the Olympics.
This is true love.
It doesn't work so well because the batteries are running down.
It's been a long week.
I have no one to talk to.
It's completely dark.
I will teach you how to skate next Sunday.
I haven't finished reading the book yet.
I don't have a lot of time for this.
I am moving next month.
Tom drank lemonade.
A beautiful woman was seated one row in front of me.
I like this job.
It's very clean.
We're not convinced yet.
I like my friends.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
Nothing would make me happier than to see you happy.
I had a cat named Cookie.
He's tickled pink.
You won't be interested.
My house is north of the library.
I need to take Monday off.
Be nicer to your sister.
Shouldn't you be in school?
The bathtub needs to be cleaned.
He stopped talking to them.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
You're not one of us.
My family is a large one.
We're old friends.
Tom is kidding.
Where's the soap?
You're eating like you haven't eaten anything all day.
You won't need me.
Tom tried to remember what Mary had told him.
He's already left.
They're sunbathing around the pool.
Call me this evening.
We're friends.
It was interesting.
I slept on my stomach.
I'm on my way home from work.
Are you courageous?
Would you like to go to the aquarium with me?
Are you actually serious?
British and Japanese cars have steering wheels on the right side.
Tom came yesterday.
Take one of these.
They want you dead.
Why would anybody eat pickled cabbage?
How do you think I feel?
Are you allowed to go?
Don't forget to flush the toilet.
We should've phoned ahead and reserved a table.
I'm being punished.
Do you know the girl waving at us over there?
He's a tycoon.
I haven't seen you for ages.
She told him that she was happy.
You didn't work hard enough.
How could you be so cruel?
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
What kind of changes do you want us to make?
I'm going to church.
He wore red pants.
Bulgarian is very similar to Russian.
Do you plan to buy that car?
Do you know what that means?
I'll never deceive you.
I'm right outside.
Why didn't you listen to your father?
Tom elbowed me in the ribs.
Stop sucking up to the teacher.
Are you ready to fly?
She decided to marry him.
I need to go get some money out of the bank.
Who locked the door?
Companies with diversified holdings tend to weather economics shocks better.
Let me introduce you to a new way of doing that.
Tom always likes to joke around.
It's going to be very cold tonight.
She advised him to study harder.
I know that you said that.
I am reading a book.
Tom has chickens.
You'd better leave now.
That book is familiar to all young children.
The old man begged me for money.
He muttered something under his breath.
I guess I'd better start packing.
He is watching TV now.
Which horse did you bet on?
Oranges are sweeter than lemons.
Probably he will come soon.
He is the man you can rely on.
Tom seldom speaks to Mary anymore.
We need some more firewood.
I hope to pass my exams.
Clean your room.
You will receive a confirmation email after your account has been activated by an administrator.
They made the right choice.
I'm coming home.
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work.
What's that?
What was in it for you?
It might not even work.
Do you have a family?
I stand by what I said before.
I don't know if I can do it.
She won the one hundred meter race.
My wife is away for the weekend.
I slept for three hours.
I think that's up to you now.
Why would you ever want to do a job like that?
My college has dormitories.
He turned to his friend for help.
He waited for several seconds and opened the door.
Who's that man?
You and Tom are made to be together.
Are you free after school?
She went to Paris to study music.
I'll send you the bill.
Tom took notes during the meeting.
I saw him crossing the street.
He belittles others to make himself feel important.
I thought you were older than me.
We haven't heard the last of this.
I think there's something wrong.
The streets in Tokyo are full on Saturdays.
You must have made a mistake.
He visited Japan while he was President.
Tom doesn't know who Mary wants to give the bottle of wine to.
The difference between the right word and almost the right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.
I refused at first.
When do you mean to start?
How did you vote on that matter?
She kept crying all the time.
I wanted to know why you didn't come yesterday.
I am a man.
I can't believe he kissed you.
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
Thanks for showing me how to do that.
My wife holds the purse strings in our family.
I'm no friend of yours.
There was not enough fuel.
This novel bores me.
No one knows anything.
You're very skeptical.
I used to have a dog.
The light went on.
He teaches us history.
I was frustrated.
The doctor is taking care of Tom.
They hate us.
Never tell a lie.
I wish you hadn't found me.
She showed him the photo.
I don't even know where.
Tom's grandmother looks healthy.
Maybe he'll come tomorrow.
What I did was wrong.
Are you trying to tell me something?
You're the most intelligent person I know.
This problem is worth discussing.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
Why did you let me sleep so late?
Tom looked at it more closely.
They had a heated discussion.
The ice on the lake is too thin to bear your weight.
They want you dead.
The roses are blooming early this year.
Tom's father is an alcoholic.
I have to go and buy a newspaper.
It rained for hours and hours.
It's not that strange.
I remember that place.
This one is different.
Nobody likes that guy.
He acted in his own interest.
The Normans conquered England in 1066.
It's simpler and more reliable.
You sort of hinted that you wanted me to ask you out.
We abhor violence.
He was visibly bothered.
Tom can be extremely dangerous.
Are they coming back tonight?
I beg you to stay.
Day will break soon.
Let's presume you're right.
He was too stunned to talk.
You should say what you think.
What should I feed my dog?
Tom didn't get caught.
Tom loved to do that.
I know Tom is a biologist.
The road is blocked.
There's no point doing that.
Try it again.
Tom can't control his anger.
You'd be amazed how long it takes Tom to get ready in the morning.
I am very tall.
He added a little sugar to the coffee.
We have the situation under control.
I'm not coming back home.
I'm going to head back to the office.
Tom glanced at the others.
Is this seat free?
You're no different.
I have nothing to say.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I can see the top of the mountain.
When did you take the exam?
Aren't you sleepy?
He believes in the existence of ghosts.
We're adaptable.
I'd be delighted to sing for you.
I know what you know.
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?
Bad news travels fast.
She is rarely late for appointments.
I heard a loud explosion.
I want you to go upstairs.
Tom is probably with Mary.
We need to get you to a hospital.
When are you going to get married?
Loosen up.
Somebody had drowned her in the bathtub.
We heard what sounded like gunshots.
He began his meal by drinking half a glass of ale.
We can give it a try.
Somebody left the lights on.
Is it all paid for?
Don't worry. I have insurance.
Mary must be Tom's girlfriend.
I have nothing else to wear.
How could you say such a thing?
They grow oranges in California.
She is no match for me.
Tom asked Mary to call the police.
I know nothing but this.
I must remind you of your promise.
I was deceived by her appearance.
I was able to succeed because of your advice.
It's good for us to eat vegetables every day.
I don't particularly care.
You said you wanted a family.
It's in times like these that the character of a person becomes apparent.
Why is it important to recycle?
Give me a couple minutes to get dressed.
We eat fish raw.
I'm on holiday.
We heard screams.
I think these are genuine.
We're happy to be here.
I haven't lost any weight.
She is getting prettier and prettier.
I didn't think you were home.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
I really must be going.
You are taller than she is.
I think you were right.
Get your things together.
Does Tom have a fishing license?
How did it get there?
They were frustrated.
The password you have entered is invalid.
Water is heavier than oil.
Why did Tom need to go?
He chose not to run for the presidential election.
That's very possible.
Was that a coincidence?
I could've helped you out.
I hate this school.
Tom's famous.
Are you hurt anywhere?
She was advised by him not to go.
It's on the sofa.
Keep in mind that you must die.
I think she is sick. She has a temperature.
Why did you try to run away?
The aim is to be out of the country within the hour.
That's a different story.
They let me go.
Go away before they see you here.
I'm very sad to hear that.
Is that a problem?
I'm heartbroken.
I can take care of you.
His old car is on its last legs.
His father is conservative and old-fashioned.
This could take a while.
That's not what I meant.
Desperate needs lead to desperate deeds.
He needs you.
I didn't get the point of his speech.
I've made up my mind to give back all the money I stole.
Are you sure that you want to do this?
He was too tired to go any farther.
This is what Tom gave me.
It wasn't an accident.
Tom is the only person Mary knows here.
You have chosen the best.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
You should choose a job in relation to your talents and interests.
Would you be willing to help?
Tom was trying not to smile.
How do you know they're looking for us?
How many audiobooks do you have on your iPod?
My grandmother lived to be ninety-five years old.
I went to Canada when I was a child.
Tom doesn't know anything about computers.
Stay a moment.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
It is fine today.
We are traveling on a tight budget.
I can't get rid of my cold.
Just tell me what happened.
That is a pure waste of time.
The lake was frozen.
Are you a criminal?
He suggested that I accompany him to the party.
Do you have any idea what happened?
Tom didn't see it.
I thought you might feel the same way.
I talked about music.
I am looking forward to seeing you again.
Are you going to sing here?
I just don't think I can do it.
Have you ever been in prison?
Can you slow down a little?
He leveled his gun at me.
Men are better at this than women.
I'll tell you only if you promise to keep it to yourself.
I will write you back soon.
Tom got back in the car.
Armenia is a mountainous country.
The referee made the right decision.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
Do you miss it?
Do you want beef or pork?
The store is open.
We hope it doesn't happen again.
I think you need a lawyer.
She trusted you.
I have no friends to help me.
This is nothing.
I'd like your permission to use it.
You're really weird.
This river is two hundred kilometers long.
How much is the monthly rate?
"Are the drinks free? ""Only for ladies."""
You seem upset.
A decision had to be made.
I told Tom why I needed to do that.
You look like a little girl in that dress.
I just wanted to tell you how pleased I am.
This boat is seaworthy.
It's going to get quite hot today.
That's not a good sign.
This is the village where I was born.
Loosen up.
How many sisters do you have?
Does it hurt when you chew?
Don't you think it might be a bit heavy?
It's impossible to take on more work at the moment.
I want to know why you aren't ready.
Do your best in everything.
My explanation may sound strange.
You might try that.
I'm glad this worked out.
I'm thinking about you.
Do you like cats?
Is there something you haven't told me?
I know that you're smart.
Where is my comb?
I like walking by myself.
They gave up.
I cannot find time to read the book.
You must be very proud of your son.
She stayed at a hotel.
I was skeptical.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
I understand your position perfectly.
My father quit drinking.
I appreciate your concern.
I gave him my address.
I haven't seen you in years.
You don't seem very sure.
Tom has more money than he needs.
I don't think that you need to do that.
You have to ask me for it.
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up?
We need to win.
They're probably Americans.
It's a very good question.
Give me my drink.
Don't you know who I am?
I think you'll regret it if you don't go with us.
Try not to inhale the fumes.
You're very intelligent.
This is my umbrella.
We talked about it just yesterday.
Would you like to see your room?
He never drinks alcohol.
Have you slept?
Why do girls I don't like like me?
I think it's time for you to grow up.
It's no problem.
Spanish is her mother tongue.
They both laughed.
I despise Tom.
I pretended that I was working.
How long did it last?
Teachers should deal fairly with their students.
Wait a minute.
This can't be what you want.
No one knows the answer.
I read this book when I was in high school.
He advertised his house for sale.
Do you have professional experience?
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
I'd better tell you the truth.
We adopted an alternative method.
I just made it under the wire.
Admission is free for children.
It pays in the long run to buy goods of high quality.
I am looking for a jewelry store.
I'm saving this seat for a friend.
A DNA test showed he was innocent.
Everybody blames you.
Time is on my side.
She is his friend.
I've always liked your hair that way.
Will you introduce me to her?
We arrived to find a huge meal ready for us.
This is extremely important.
People say that he is the richest man in this town.
I don't know any more than you do.
I wish I could go to the party with you.
How much is this ring?
Are you up?
We could ask Tom what he thinks.
How old is your grandfather?
The movie's about to start.
What are some foods you usually eat with chopsticks?
Even my parents don't like me.
Would you mind telling me one thing?
Tom filled out the application for me.
How can you eat that?
You can't just come in here and start ordering people around.
I took control of the situation.
Are they worth it?
He's nothing more than a common thug.
He became world famous.
I stuck with it until I was finished.
School begins the day after tomorrow.
Who's going to pay for all this?
What time is dinner served?
What would you like for dessert?
Honesty is a virtue.
What time did you wake up this morning?
Don't touch anything without asking.
Tom still despises me.
"Will you help me with my English homework? ""Certainly."""
She bought him a dog.
You can't just walk in here.
She's lost her car key.
The company abandoned that project.
This should be plenty.
Look at that koala over there.
I thought we were happy.
They entered into a discussion about the issue.
Man is doomed to die.
Why don't you help?
I wish I could paint like that.
They were members of the middle class.
Do you like to dance?
The owners appointed him manager.
This car needs to be washed.
He asked me questions similar to those asked by many others.
We picked the number at random.
Take that back.
Get the box.
We have already finished our dinner.
Get in the back seat.
She was ready to help him with washing the car.
This CD belongs to my son.
I left my phone in the car.
Yokohama is a beautiful port town.
This is very impressive.
I'm thinking about visiting my friend next year.
I think you're being a little too careful.
Tom is the star of the show.
It's dangerous to live near a volcano.
Everybody wanted to do that.
They drank way too much.
His son is a genius.
Now it's too late.
Nobody can help you.
How can something so wrong feel so right?
Tom doesn't care what other people think.
Don't pay attention to her.
Let's bounce.
You're pretty.
How do I delete this file?
Stop staring at me like that.
You have to pay taxes.
How much more work do you have?
Why are you being so distant?
"What toppings do you want on the pizza? ""Anything but anchovies."""
You won't believe who sat down next to me.
This fact proves her innocence.
I usually walk to school.
Who picked you for this job?
I doubt the new proposal will be accepted.
Nobody's as fast as you.
You are morons.
She is appreciated by everyone.
The school is on the hill.
The demon lord finally lost conciousness and fell to the floor with a thud.
You're a bit shorter than I am.
It wasn't my idea.
I thought we were welcome here.
Shall we go?
It was a team effort.
They go shopping.
He has been warned on several occasions.
Can't you do anything to stop them?
I hope you won't tell Tom about this.
I've never heard of you.
Could you lend me some money until this weekend?
The store can supply us with anything we need.
They swam.
The offer is too good to be turned down.
Tom has a dentist appointment.
There's nowhere you can hide.
They often go on picnics by bicycle.
I haven't seen Tom since Monday.
He jumped into the water.
He's very understanding.
She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth.
It's bedtime.
Few students use pencils these days.
I was unable to prevent this.
In what kind of situations would you do that?
How did you get here?
I'll never be as good as Tom.
I need thread to sew on this button.
We visited our father's grave.
Tom kept reading.
He exchanged yen for dollars.
What else do you have?
Don't forget your things.
They are the same age.
Just get out of here.
Let me deal with this.
Let me pay my share.
It's a shame that you're not coming.
He's doing it right.
Have a drink while you're waiting.
That's no excuse.
I knew this day would come.
I really want a beer.
I brought you a gift.
"Where are your books? ""They are on the desk."""
Tom couldn't do what I wanted him to do.
I haven't seen any of his films.
I want you to be my friend again.
Tom was quick to volunteer.
I hope it wasn't too boring.
Can you climb up that tree?
Learning a foreign language is hard work.
She doesn't care how she dresses.
The hunter shot a bear.
I'm glad you weren't here.
I can't be seen with you.
This car handles well.
I gave up on the idea of buying a house.
I must go alone.
Tom has lost another umbrella.
Your answer is to the point.
Have you got a match?
I gave my seat to the old lady.
How much should they get?
I just wish it were easier to do.
They gathered at the coffee shop for a meeting.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
This book is so difficult that I can't read it.
I will not help you.
We are going to make up for lost time by taking a short cut.
I've got lots of questions.
She smiled at the sight of her mother.
My heart's aching.
Tom's died.
You have my sympathies.
Tom noticed that his hands weren't clean.
This movie is worth seeing.
You're so bossy.
Call me back.
I can't imagine that.
I see you are ready.
I love American movies.
I remember reading about it.
Tom commutes to school by bicycle.
My plan is to buy a car.
I don't have cancer.
Tell me how you solved the problem.
Tom left.
You're going to be OK.
I don't see why I need to do this.
Are you still interested?
She is going to learn how to drive.
I can't promise you that.
Where did you go?
I'm not doing this for me.
What are you grinning about?
I don't think we're going to be able to catch the train you want to catch.
You are very beautiful.
Come immediately.
I'm as tall as you.
I'm not sure I have time for that.
I didn't say you did that.
How many slices of meat would you like?
Do you think so?
It was disgusting.
She was too proud to ask him for help.
I don't know why you're all so angry.
I saw a man enter the room.
Are you sure you can handle this?
I've got an appointment tomorrow with Tom.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
I didn't think you needed one.
I had my bicycle stolen last night.
I had never seen a more beautiful sight.
His mother looks young for her age.
There's a rumor going around.
I feel ashamed that I got such bad marks in the examination.
He's your friend.
My grandfather was an archaeologist.
What a beautiful dress!
Tom has a voracious appetite.
I don't believe anything you say anymore.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
The dog is sleeping.
We must learn to live in harmony with nature.
Why are you acting like my mother?
Are you going to work until 10:00?
He has eyes at the back of his head.
You ought to have seen it.
The coach urged his team not to be complacent following their four consecutive wins.
You're smarter than me.
You had a long day.
Tom screamed at the top of his lungs.
I want to talk.
Do you think anyone can see us?
Do you have to do this right now?
They're living in a fantasy world.
I use Google almost every day.
I'm in love with you and I want to marry you.
Tom said he was starving.
I don't want to kill you.
Tom never said no.
We insist that a meeting be held as soon as possible.
Tom and Mary value their privacy.
The floor had a good shine.
You cannot do this.
Have you arrived at a decision yet?
I'd never hire Tom.
This might help.
Be careful what you wish for.
I had to make a decision.
It is no use asking him again.
I want these people out of here.
I outrank you.
Criminals should be punished.
He refused to pay.
We are leaving Japan next month.
I'll never be that famous.
I thought you already paid the bill.
She explained the matter to me.
Tom escaped unscathed from the wreckage.
You can't deny that anymore.
They are very big.
Who did you talk to?
She watched him drawing a picture.
Tell us exactly what happened.
I didn't eat everything that she served me.
It made me laugh.
You aren't yourself today.
Do you think I don't know what's going on?
Tom doesn't have a dad.
Did I say something funny?
He has worked out a quicker way to get the job finished.
This is obviously fake.
He is my colleague.
Why don't you sit here?
Tom has narrow shoulders.
May I speak to you for a moment?
I'm really proud of that.
He will be punished.
I'm still in town.
You should have refused his offer.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't know Mary.
That is no business of yours.
I'm a twin.
I didn't realize you were awake.
Why don't we take him a bottle of wine?
I don't know how to make you happy.
About how many English words do you know?
He shot at me.
I don't want to be rich.
Why have you been avoiding me?
I think you did great.
Have confidence in yourself.
How was the reunion?
Should I go or would you like me to stay?
Tom looks just like a guy I know.
That'll take a long time.
Tom was wearing an old T-shirt with holes in it.
Nobody's going to hire you.
I'm very concerned about your health.
Tom gave his father a tie on Father's Day.
They finished their meal.
He's coming closer.
His bad leg prevented him from winning the race.
You need to be more patient.
She thinks money and happiness are the same.
I don't think Tom can do that.
How can you do this to me?
Tom must go back to Australia.
Do you have a question?
We have a new neighbor.
Look what I've found.
You should tell him the truth.
What's the matter?
I liked your story.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
But don't you think that it's a little big? asked the shopkeeper.
What could I do?
Do you eat rice every day?
I need time to unwind.
He lost his life in a traffic accident.
Were you even tempted?
I'll tell Tom what a great job you did.
He put me in touch with the kidnappers.
Don't jump to conclusions.
I didn't realize you were already here.
He is less intelligent than me.
Don't let me catch you doing anything like this again.
Can you make it so she can get on that TV program?
Why don't you go ahead?
All of my children were born in Boston.
I was just making a suggestion.
Tom filled the bucket with ice.
Are we going to talk about this or not?
He knows how to behave in public.
I want to get rid of it.
Help me make a list.
I'm going to work during the spring vacation.
Tom told me that he didn't feel like eating.
We're both telling the truth.
He made fun of my accent.
A number of passengers were injured.
I'll be back tonight.
Tom was so hungry that he ate dog food.
I went to sleep as soon as I got home.
What was the question?
Do you think he's really into me?
You have to trust me.
Tom found no one in the house.
Was there a lot of traffic?
I have an appointment to dine with him.
You don't seem very satisfied.
Are you really a princess?
Nobody likes you.
I have a son not much older than you.
Did the car look old?
I guess I just got carried away.
It took me several hours to draw it.
It is too long ago.
Many flights were canceled because of the typhoon.
What are you doing here this time of night?
Will you tell me how to get to your house?
I'm catching on.
I just love to watch Tom play.
Why do you want to know?
Is Tom doing okay?
I can't blame him.
He said that he was going home the following day.
The rebels sabotaged the railroad.
I'm not even sure I want to see that movie.
You're not alone anymore.
The diamond was set in a gold ring.
There were no jobs.
We had to make the best of a bad deal.
It may break.
I've done it before.
It's gotten better.
Tom sat down and waited.
I realized that I didn't want to spend any more time dealing with that problem.
They should've known that this would happen.
You're grown up now.
I finished my math homework.
Is there something wrong?
The best player of all times was Pel.
Thank you for sending me a nice card.
I've been bitten by mosquitos all over my arm.
She is used to speaking in public.
He does not like to wait until the last moment to do a thing.
We should pay more attention to environmental problems.
Are you a natural blonde?
You should obey the traffic laws when you drive.
Who are we competing against?
He keeps on asking me for money.
He ignored his father's advice.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
I like dark chocolate.
It is raining all the time.
Some Asian men wear makeup.
My mother made a sweater for me.
I know that this is important to you.
She handed him the money that she owed him.
How lucky you are!
I borrowed some money from a friend.
Look what I did.
I didn't think you'd be so late.
I'll leave it up to you.
Do your homework by yourself.
I took care of that.
Something happened.
I came here hoping to see Tom.
Tom is doing a crossword puzzle.
Our car ran out of gas after two minutes.
We have a crisis.
I stopped laughing.
Do you have any similar expressions in French?
I like to eat meat.
I know that Tom is frightened.
I only eat kosher food.
I respect your opinion.
The meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
Tom voted for Mary.
You don't need to lie.
Everything is closed.
How many times have I told you not to use that word?
I'll obey.
It is time to go to bed.
He gave it to me.
We like to learn foreign languages.
I came to see if you were OK.
