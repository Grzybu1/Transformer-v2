I got my son to repair the door.
I have a job for you.
I am sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
She brought up two children.
I've never flown in an airplane.
He asked for some money.
No one has the right to tell you how to raise your child.
There must be something in there.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
Tom visited Australia in 2013.
I need to keep my family fed.
Are you in a bad mood?
He has a very dry sense of humor.
She picked up the phone.
My uncle gave me a pair of shoes.
Do you mind if I park here?
The meeting hasn't started yet.
I will go if you go.
Come back in an hour.
We took shelter under a tree.
Try and stop me.
Who's that cute girl I saw you with at the mall?
Would you like some water?
I left you a note.
Is this what you want?
We need to do this right.
We're going to buy ourselves a car.
Is there a point?
When do you plan to start?
What do I get in return?
He whispered something to me.
I'd like to run a big stock farm.
It's very easy to use.
That'll be all for now.
Put this in your backpack.
Would you like me to take a look?
Have you ever seen a film this good?
It just doesn't count.
I guess that's how I'd do it.
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
You must respect your elders.
We know this song.
It's too bad she can't come to the party.
Tom could make you laugh.
You have nothing to lose.
Tom wishes for his son to inherit his estate.
I translated everything Tom wrote into French.
You have two balls.
Tom bought a bottle of olive oil.
He kept the invaders at bay with a machine gun.
I'm getting kind of hungry. Let's go get something to eat.
I saw a light far away.
Would you like another glass of wine?
I told you about this last week.
Does she have a boyfriend?
What can you see?
I wonder who did that.
I'm not at all interested in physics.
Are you talking to yourself again?
I'm as shocked as you are.
It was a very exciting game.
How many times do I have to say that?
Tom said that he was thirsty.
I'll wait.
We'll talk about it later.
Tom bought me this book.
This trip was your idea.
I'm not going to reveal their secrets.
Do you know who painted this picture?
He made an important scientific discovery.
Did you sleep all right?
I like your smile.
She and I usually agree.
Do it yourself.
I think I'll do that.
There is no reason for you to feel inferior to anyone.
No criminal charges were filed.
Autumn is here.
We're all bored.
Tom looked like he was unhappy.
The boys were injured.
We hoped you'd forget.
He has gone to Britain.
Thanks so much.
Let me take you to someplace where you'll be safe.
Don't be a copycat.
Tom is in his office at his desk.
He goes to China in May.
Let Tom answer.
We were kids together.
I just want to ask you some questions.
I spoke with Tom today.
Are you listening?
No one I know can afford to eat out anymore.
I know Tom is troubled.
These dogs are big.
He left a large fortune to his son.
The police set out to solve the crime.
I knew Tom would help me.
They knew exactly what they were doing.
