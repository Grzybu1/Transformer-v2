I'll be with you in just a second.
Don't drink out of my glass.
I see a pattern.
I've got something to show you.
All we can do is to wait for him.
What're you going to do about it?
I have many talents.
Tom insisted that I go.
Raise your left hand.

How do you know I'm not the one who did it?
We should go this way.

Do you have a twin sister?
Are you open on Saturday?
Don't forget to turn the light off.
I've been very impressed.
The young man lives in an old house.
That's not my computer.
Let's leave as soon as Tom gets here.
You are not a doctor.
We've come too far to quit now.

What kind of yogurt do you like best?
I hope you have insurance.
I don't regret a thing.
I'm looking for your sister. Where is she?
Are you hungry?
Tell me.
There's nothing else I want to do.

Mother is cooking in the kitchen.
Where do you want to sleep tonight?
Have another drink.
Tom bought a bathrobe.
What a night!
I want to find out where it came from.

Put some clothes on.

I misunderstood.
Correct the underlined words.
He left the Mexican capital to return to Texas.
How do you propose we solve this problem?
I've already spoken to Tom about that.
I arrived here about five o'clock.
Maybe you were followed.
Tom is listening to music.
That poor family survives on food stamps.
Have you seen Tom's latest invention?
I don't smoke.

He was my first boyfriend.
My life was a wreck.
There are a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
Do you still have Tom's umbrella?
I wish you success in your work.
Tom visited Australia in 2013.
Don't judge others by the color of their skin.
We cannot overestimate the value of health.
That'll only make things worse.
I'm not ready to retire yet.
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
He felt ill at ease.
Can you come at nine?

We'll fight to the last.
She was perfect.
I expected you to be here for lunch.
You can't come in.
Why are you insulting me?
My brother can drive a car.
Tom answered the teacher's questions.
Smoking is bad for your health.
My children had eaten all the cookies by the time I got home.
Did you win the trophy?
Each child was given a present.
I want you to help me clean it up.
It depends on you.
I began to sweat.
I was thrown out of the house with everything I owned.
My birthday was last week.
They invited me to dinner.
This is the dictionary I told you about yesterday.

It's hard to swat a fly with your bare hand.
Let's do this as quickly as possible.
She has had to stay here.
I bought that book for Tom.
Draw me a seven-pointed star.
Are you still interested?
Your mother and father are dead.
Tom said that Mary wasn't in Boston.
It was fine all day.
This hut is a very special place.
This is yours.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what you did last weekend.
Tom congratulated Mary on her graduation.
He likes games of chance.
Life is so strange.
Tom shouldn't have borrowed Mary's car.
I'd better call you back.
You're all set.
Do I look like I'm busy?
I really like garlic.
You didn't tell me everything.
Wait a sec.
Look out of the window.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
Did he look like a doctor?
He will never live up to his parent's expectations.
You're going to need help.
It is to his advantage.
I don't like your coming late every day.
Tom is leaving early.
My dress is ruined.
I was born the year the war ended.
I stayed with my uncle.
We always have a party on his birthday.
Would you mind shutting the door?
You can't swim.
Patience is a rare virtue these days.
I think I have tendinitis.
I'd like to see you before I leave for Europe.
I think you'll know everybody at the party.
You're the one who trained me.
Tom doesn't know where Mary parked her car.
Would it be all right if I visited you today?
I didn't want to brag.
What were your parents like?
There's something about him that just doesn't sit right with me.
We forgot to lock the door.
No one knows her name.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
That man is dangerous.
I was very busy today.
What do you do in the afternoon?
I will do whatever I think is right.
I am truly sorry.
Let's talk about this.
I hate this town.
I'll ask my father for money.
Neither one is acceptable.
I see why you don't want to go there.
You can't be happy all the time.
Why didn't you come?
What do you think about global warming?
I thought I gave you the key yesterday.
She came to my aid.
I spent all morning chopping wood.
Why isn't anybody doing anything?
Take your shot.
I locked myself in my room.
His warm way with people had made him hugely popular.
You're supposed to help your friends when they're in trouble.
I arrived later than usual.
I'm going to take a shower.
Were they good?
Please see to it that the dog doesn't go out.
Don't take this personally.
I'm capable of dealing with problems like this myself.
Tom treated Mary like a queen.
The ship set sail for Bombay.
We need to move quickly.
We're on our way home.
What do they want us to do?
I'm not leaving with you.
I have a question to ask you.
That's generous of you.
How important are children to you?
She's not yet heard the news.
What kind of person would spend so much money on a bicycle?
Let's not tell anybody that we're married.
The present government has many problems.
We all quit.
I know what has happened.
I appreciate the support.
Tom often gets headaches.
What happened here?
Do you want to go shopping with me?
Where's the nearest train station?
Tom is swimming in the river.
There's nothing on television.
Do you swim often?
You are taller than me.
I walk to school.
What sort of person are you?
I've got to get back home by midnight.
Mary doesn't usually wear jewelry.
The fire destroyed the tall building.
It's nothing I can't handle.
The dog's collar is red.
They are still children.
I felt relieved when my plane landed safely.
Can you read this manuscript?
I am no longer tired.
Everybody left.
You've been very kind to me.
What're the chances that Tom will actually get the job?
A nuclear war will bring about the destruction of mankind.
How could I refuse?
I'm not used to this heat.
His name is known to me.
We're realistic.
Dozens of students gathered there.
You're innocent.
We already sang that song.
My college has a dormitory.
Please write it down.
Do you like Boston?
I paid for them.
Tom did everything I told him to.
I shouldn't have done that without permission.
I tried for almost an hour.
I have to iron my shirt.
What are they going to do?
Ring the bell.
Can we do that?
Here or to go?
Let's turn and go back now.
Tom was in prison for several years.
You could have been happy.
What're you doing with my car?
Do you have dinner plans?
We ran out of food.
Where's the dining car?
I'm stunned.
You're such an idiot!
It went without a hitch.
How much does this phone cost?
I should clean the room.
Follow that car.
Don't touch the glass.
I can handle it.
I had no idea you were involved.
I think you should grow a beard.
Does Tom dye his hair?
I just assumed that you'd be here.
They were naive.
How many have you had?
I don't think I'm the only one who noticed.
I must go alone.
Tom'll understand.
I don't like to sing in public.
I think I've figured out why Tom has never learned to speak French so well.
You're very wise.
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours.
Smoking is forbidden here.
A fallen tree obstructed the road.
Tom doesn't want to be disappointed.
She likes sleeping.
I saw many people barbecuing in the park.
My brother has become a priest.
It is unlikely that it'll rain tomorrow.
No one's here.
I'm glad that I still live here.
Around half of the audience were female.
I'm far from happy about this situation.
I'm about to leave.
This is something new.
We meant no harm.
Thank you for helping me write my resume.
Do you know why?
I don't want to wear a wig.
Does this not please you?
Do you want some cherry pie?
She goes jogging every morning before breakfast.
You've made a huge mistake.
He helped me do my homework.
Did you hear what we were saying?
Do you have any idea how important your test grades are?
I didn't know why I wasn't supposed to go to that part of town.
I'm the coach.
I think Tom may be telling the truth.
How about taking a walk?
I decided to ask for my friend's help.
Ask Tom if he's going to the party tonight.
Tom didn't want to come to Australia with us.
Tom is hiding somewhere.
Your zipper is open.
I really don't want to be alone tonight.
Why do I even care?
What's your first name?
We may have missed the bus.
I've reduced the amount of meat I eat.
I thought I heard music.
Tom thinks I can do it.
Do you feel like going swimming?
You're very good at this.
That's how it always was.
She is expecting a baby in June.
I've lost my filling.
Why don't you just back off?
What was the outcome of the election?
I wanted to go back to your village.
I'm so sick of this.
I sliced the sandwich diagonally.
The brain needs a continuous supply of blood.
Tom's parents usually speak French to each other.
Tom and Mary are looking for John.
I'm married to a lawyer.
That's the maximum.
I'm going to build a fire.
Tom was trying to control his anger.
You don't have to tell me this.
We won't go back to Boston.
The flag is up.
Tom doesn't want to work tomorrow.
She studies as hard as any student in her class.
Why are you mean to me?
It's hardly raining at all.
This place isn't safe anymore.
I don't find that comforting.
Nothing is the matter with me.
I will be sixteen next birthday.
I said there's no one here.
He can be proud of his father.
I need to talk to him.
Tom has been living in Boston since he graduated from college.
I'm a little bit tired today.
He's doing his best.
How many did you get?
My grandfather was killed in World War II.
May I try it on?
What do you want to learn?
I was born and raised right here.
Do you know how old I am?
They are five in all.
Can we create something out of nothing?
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
Are they still in bed?
I really think you should stop doing that.
What kind of sick weirdo are you?
I made a fool of myself.
I found what I was looking for in the drawers.
We have to be serious.
It's embarrassing.
Its origin remains unknown.
Tom didn't trust Mary.
I am in the habit of taking a walk every day.
Stupidity is no excuse.
Are both of you still single?
They have come.
Tom lives near us.
Whose side are you on?
Tom bought a new tennis racket.
I thought I heard you.
You can take whatever you like.
You don't look your age.
Take a cookie.
I am terribly afraid of snakes.
I want you to get a good night's rest.
The teacher allowed him to go home.
Tom had bruises all over his body after the fight.
They went into the woods for a picnic.
You're such an idiot!
This is awesome.
I didn't cause the explosion.
I think this is the only way to do it.
Let me kiss you one last time.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
Children often try to imitate their elders.
I love you more and more each day.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
You're not dead yet.
I can't believe you just did that.
I don't trust you.
She pretty much keeps to herself.
I'd like to eat something.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
Just act as if nothing has happened.
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
I think you're contradicting yourself.
We both competed.
The drunken men made derogatory remarks toward the women in the club.
Can I tell you what bugs me?
Both are alive.
We did what we were told.
Why didn't you come?
You're not allowed to leave this room.
This looks like silk.
Sign this.
You have only to give him a little help.
I have three times as many books as Tom.
Tom would never let you drive.
Don't forget that.
Did you see the sunset earlier? It was really beautiful.
They were unimpressed.
He has an unpronounceable name.
Did you see a doctor?
Were you busy?
I don't know who did that.
Are you getting paid for this?
What is aspirin made of?
Students are supposed to study hard.
I was entirely ignorant of the matter.
I'm sneaky.
I will stay there.
Let's talk about love.
I'm beginning to think you're serious.
Tom isn't a friend of mine.
You're silly.
Tom checked the date.
Tom lives in Boston.
She can't swim.
Are you ready to do that?
I fear no one.
She followed him home to find out where he lived.
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
Tom has trouble sleeping.
I was terribly offended.
I'd rather just let people talk.
I still need to talk to you.
I am not getting involved.
Which cap is yours?
I asked him about the accident.
It has been over three years since I moved here.
Maybe you could talk to Tom.
The campfire has burned down.
Don't spread yourself too thin.
He'll wait for us to call him.
Tom brushed his daughter's hair.
I want you to stop.
Thanks very much for having me to dinner the other night.
I'll give it my best shot.
Stay away from my daughter.
That's why we're here.
Did you see what I did?
Tom did a good job.
Why limit yourself to just one?
It has a flaw.
They were scolded by the teacher.
I don't know what's happening.
Japan has a high population density.
Somebody's coming.
I love how you think of other people's needs before your own.
I made you a pair of mittens.
Why do people kill themselves?
I'm ashamed of my body.
I'm going to go sit in my car.
I can't do that.
You're bright.
It isn't optional.
I believe in my abilities.
Were the windows closed?
I hope to see you.
Sport is good for your health.
You are welcome to do anything you like.
Is that all you bought?
I didn't tell him everything.
I feel like I have to be there.
We were all on the bus.
No problem.
I knew Tom was lying to us.
They're back where they want to be.
Tom just returned from Boston.
Why are you irritated?
What did you want to show us?
Do I have to wear this?
I'm sure this can wait.
I can't accept this theory.
Can you read that?
I promise I won't bite.
They won't let Tom out.
Don't move till I get back.
The decision hasn't yet been made.
Will he come to the meeting next week?
They won't let this pass.
I thought we could use the cloth napkins.
I have errands to run.
I've got this one covered.
This is worse than everything else.
Grief drove her mad.
Tom has asked us to help him.
Tom isn't a very good farmer.
I can't spend money I don't have.
Who am I to complain?
I'm surprised to see you again.
His house was broken into last night.
The bell had already rung when I got to school.
Do you want me to ask Tom?
I felt cheated.
I like white roses better than red ones.
I can't do anything without help.
You could sleep in the hammock.
You never know when you'll need one.
Tell me about it.
Tom isn't doing anything.
We don't have a problem.
Be content.
Can you walk on stilts?
There is a dog on the bridge.
I don't think I can eat this.
I'll start with a beer.
She did not listen.
Maybe I shouldn't do that.
You're wrong in this case.
It's a cloak-and-dagger operation.
I was touched by this movie.
That tie suits you very well.
This road goes to the park.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
The phone was off the hook.
Is anybody there?
Will you drink another cup of coffee?
I wrote that.
I'm sure there's a connection.
The house gets painted every five years.
I bought this hat when I was in Boston.
His appearance deceived me.
I wrote a postcard to Tom.
Let me show you where to put that.
I didn't hear you come in.
Would you like to sing?
We've decided to do that.
What can I get you to drink?
He made her cry.
Tom says that he didn't do it.
Aren't you ashamed of the way you behaved?
The reverse seems true.
Do you fly frequently?
She availed herself of every opportunity.
Prices have dropped recently.
Do you have the money?
I feel strongly about this.
Get rid of things you don't use.
I looked at my watch and noted that it was past five.
Someone knocked on the door.
The rain prevented me from going out.
What did they hit you with?
I leave this afternoon.
I've been following you.
Please take some of them.
We're not arguing.
I'm hit!
She found a ball in the garden.
I translated everything Tom wrote into French.
The brake didn't work.
Several dozen young people participated in the demonstration.
I love the way you walk.
Tom plays tennis three times a week.
We can't do this by Friday.
It was all gone.
You only have to ask for it.
You get used to it.
Is Tom supposed to be doing that?
Do you know that girl?
Who's to say it's not what's supposed to happen?
I had no idea you were so dedicated.
Where do you want to eat?
I want to get married and I want to have kids.
Do you want to do it right now?
When does it open?
That broken vase is my grandfather's.
What are you doing with these dolls?
You always take things too easy.
He gave away all his money.
Please write your name at the bottom of this paper.
I should have done this weeks ago.
Would you mind letting me see your passport?
Men and women went into battle.
I'm here to help you.
The watch keeps accurate time.
Are you going to cut down all these trees?
Did you see the transcript?
I wish I could stay longer.
I couldn't stop laughing.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
It's hard for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
Who should I inform?
I have an errand for Tom.
I don't know anything about what happened.
I don't want people to hate me.
He was nearly drowned.
I'm not above begging in order to get the job.
We hurried to the airport only to miss the plane.
You're not fast enough.
May I go?
He set off to Paris.
He wears expensive clothes and owns a lot of jewelry.
That was supposed to be our little secret.
I have a right to be on this ship.
You don't have to answer.
I believe in friendship.
These fields produce fine crops.
Tickets are available online or at the door.
You have a good sense of humor.
That's not my fault.
I've never seen Tom behave this way before.
Are you sure this isn't going to hurt?
The violence lasted for two weeks.
What floats your boat?
Mary applied cream to her face.
Tom had never seen such a beautiful garden before.
How can you be so callous?
That's the last thing I remember.
Tom bought Mary a new car.
They love their children.
You said you were going to handle it.
Enjoy your evening.
She often goes to the movies with him.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Tom should really study French.
It is never too late to learn.
I couldn't help laughing when I heard that story.
Both of them started laughing.
I'm alive and well.
I want to know everything.
You know what they say.
I'm not satisfied.
The problem is as good as settled.
A great future lies before her.
She didn't show up.
He took her by the hand.
Tom is really proud of Mary.
I miss you when you're not here.
I moved to England from Germany when I was nine.
How about running?
I hardly know anything about you.
Be careful!
He noticed her embarrassment.
This dog will protect us.
You must be more careful to avoid making a gross mistake.
Why aren't you doing your homework?
I thought you had somewhere else to be.
We're not the only ones doing it.
Why can't I hear?
I'll make a reservation.
I couldn't stand looking at it.
Let's measure how tall you are.
I'm reliable.
How do you deal with it?
Do you agree to our proposal?
She turned away and began to cry.
He lost his job.
Why don't you eat vegetables?
That's chicken.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
The US is trying to extradite a drug lord from Mexico.
That's not my thing.
You can't live your life under these conditions.
Hold your position.
You must have been surprised to find me alone with her last night.
The nation needed more and better teachers.
She was at a loss for words to express her feeling.
Let's eat.
You must pay in advance.
I'm anxious whether I'll do well at this new job.
Could I talk to you for a minute?
Did you try playing that song on your guitar?
Do you know what the difference is?
You look familiar. Do I know you?
Can you pass me the potatoes?
He is pleased with his work.
I'd like to try this.
Do you want to eat something?
I made several mistakes in the exam.
They made fun of my clothes.
This is where my dad works.
I wonder who bought the cake.
Be more flexible.
A policeman came up to me.
Whereabouts did you say this happened?
I don't like to take on the heavy responsibilities.
We're asking you not to do that.
She has the same bag as you have.
I figured I'd find you here.
You're the one who trained me.
They have four classes in the morning.
Who sells this?
I told you before that I'm not interested in hanging out with you.
I look forward to reading your new novel.
Are you seriously thinking about getting a divorce?
Do you think I'm ugly?
Tom came into the house.
Tom put on some clothes.
I'm sure Tom told you I was coming.
Tom and I've just gotten married.
I would like you to stay with me.
We have a tight schedule.
I'd like to visit Australia.
I'm so tired of keeping secrets.
She asked me whether I know how to sew.
She didn't try to evade the truth.
I grabbed a book off the shelf.
Tom's party was boring.
He made up that story.
You said you wanted the truth.
I wish you success in your work.
I know the boy who is sitting closest to the door.
You are responsible for what you have done.
He quit smoking for the sake of his health.
Tom behaved unprofessionally.
He took off his overcoat.
Do you get it?
I'm trapped.
There's no one in your bedroom.
Who built the snowman?
Fur coats are on sale.
I want something to drink.
Don't touch it.
How does this work?
She likes the teacher.
I called you.
I think we're out of danger.
Did you play baseball yesterday?
Did you put on sunscreen?
You can't rely on his help.
He tucked the handkerchief in his pocket.
Look out of the window.
I'm off-duty.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I don't believe we've been formally introduced.
I'm sure I saw something moving.
I have a glass eye.
I really like your paintings.
He had no memory of the accident.
You don't have to apologize.
Do you have a tattoo?
He mailed a letter home.
I can carry that for you if you'd like me to.
Lead is much heavier than aluminum.
Please wait for five minutes.
Sit down!
We're glad to see you.
Don't you have a sense of justice?
Fill the bottle with water.
I'll try to fix it later.
You're liable for the debt.
My grandmother lives by herself.
You're big.
There's not much to say.
I had my bicycle fixed yesterday.
That's a pretty girl.
Congratulations!
This is bad.
I don't really have a cold.
How do you say that?
I had enough sense to get out of there.
We didn't tell you that.
We'll go jogging in the park.
I'm always happy.
I'm not asleep.
This isn't my money.
She has a pure heart.
I did so for the sake of my health.
Do you like to live in the country?
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
I did what I wanted to do.
She advised him to tell his girlfriend that he loved her.
It's just wrong.
Are you going or not?
Is there a curfew?
I was at home.
Tom can't do that.
I am sure of his success.
Everyone was shocked.
They should have told us they were moving out.
He's getting cold feet.
I'm satisfied with everything.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I don't watch TV.
There is a bag on the desk.
I anticipated trouble.
Which eye is hurting you?
You are carrying your joke a bit too far.
I was bitten in the leg by that dog.
Why are you always so happy?
Are you sure that's safe?
Why won't you look at me?
You may leave your bag here.
You don't seem so busy.
I want the other one.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
This is what you're supposed to do.
She held her breath.
The waves swallowed up the boat.
Is this some kind of scam?
Tom bought a gun.
You should not despise a man because he is poor.
You need to tell me what to do.
There's something fishy going on.
Governments usually resort to price control when inflation has reached a certain level.
Do you think it's possible?
This is highly inefficient.
I did what I was told.
They don't want you to know.
How's your father?
I felt a sudden pain in my side.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
I'll treat you.
I don't need to write it down.
I opened one eye.
Tom is more famous than I am.
There is a bridge over the pond.
Life is full of mysteries.
I hope you're not alone.
Here's your milk.
I like the color green.
Choose any dress you like.
You're a very gifted artist.
Tom is fatter than when I last saw him.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
She should know better at her age.
I could barely stand the pain.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
I ran for mayor.
Are you gonna help me or what?
I had to walk because there were no taxis.
I don't want you to go back.
Have you asked if they want one?
Look at the mountains covered with snow.
I appreciate the support.
I just want to make it up to you.
Everything seems normal enough.
I found the book which I had lost the day before.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
Tom has no conception of what it's like to be in love.
Is that you?
You have to adapt to circumstances.
I need to verify everything you've told us.
You told me that you were busy.
Tom didn't know their names.
I am sad to hear it.
It's old and clunky.
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
Which hat do you want to buy?
I saw it coming.
He's not the brightest guy in the world.
He plugged in the radio.
You're the one who trained me.
I have a complaint.
I like to party.
How do we find out what we need to know?
Stop treating me like a child.
I know you hired a lawyer.
Why don't you start at the beginning?
I have some gifts for you.
What kind of stain is that?
I went over the report.
I want to know who started it.
Eat whatever you like.
Several students came to the library.
Why would I kill your dog?
I had little to do with it.
He took a day off.
You didn't miss a thing.
I'll show you around the town.
Life begins at forty.
Is there any life on Mars?
This window won't open.
What did I say yesterday?
The typhoon gathered strength.
The dog came running to me.
This is the very best way to do it.
She's a dog.
There are signs everywhere.
What are some of your favorite foods?
I didn't think you'd leave so early.
No one was punished for the fiasco.
I plan to go. I don't care if you do or not.
We observed this plant closely for a few weeks.
He became a famous singer.
I know what they mean.
You're a little liar.
I won't be able to come tomorrow.
You've done a great job.
You are too young to travel alone.
What do you think of these?
We're surrounded by enemies.
There is no way to confirm that he is alive.
Is everybody ready?
Corporate borrowing from financial institutions is rising due to the low interest rate.
Have you ever been in love?
She's absent because she's sick.
At what point do we start to worry?
I'm done thinking.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
It's not worth much.
Cats catch mice.
Well? Will you come?
I'll help you if possible.
I don't belong to the club.
Tom told me about Mary.
This makes me sad.
Mary wore a simple white dress.
I truly loved her.
He decided not to go.
He stood there with his eyes closed.
Was that weird for you?
Never speak ill of others.
He would sometimes talk with the soldiers.
We need to find a new babysitter.
Where's the nearest gas station?
That's not true and you know it.
I watched a movie on video.
We need to get going.
You can rely on him.
I'm a little behind schedule.
You're never too old to learn.
Native Americans fought with bow and arrow.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
I need lots of time.
Shut up!
How did you come up with that?
I'll be leaving now.
Did I tell you that?
When did you become a teacher?
Why did you leave Australia?
I'm thirty.
I don't recall you saying anything about that.
I think Tom did that intentionally.
My mother feels better.
Quit gambling.
That's my business.
Are you saying no?
He turned Christian.
Tom doesn't always obey his parents.
My son can neither read nor write yet.
I never told you to quit.
Don't change a thing.
Tom grabbed Mary's right hand with his left hand.
There's a convenience store diagonally across the street.
He had the gift of prophecy.
Tom deserved everything he got.
Tom kept on crying.
You should prepare a room for the visitor.
Do you really think Tom is happy?
Do you have two computers?
It is necessary for you to go there immediately.
I'm sad without you.
He declined the offer and so did I.
Close your eyes.
Tom was my role model.
Wake Tom up.
I've eaten a great deal of food this week.
We're all ready for that.
We try to explain things across cultures; in spite of boundaries.
I have a Canadian girlfriend.
I won't go with you unless you tell me where we're going.
I have lost my camera.
What do you mean by it?
I guess we're finished.
Do it again!
It was a lie.
I didn't mean to make him cry.
I want you to analyze this.
I can't believe you're getting married.
They watched me in silence.
I'm the one who ought to apologize.
It goes without saying that smoking is bad for the health.
When will he come?
The strange-looking woman was thought to be a witch.
Tom looked at Mary and shrugged.
It wasn't me who slammed the door.
Have you finished reading that book?
Scream as loud as you can.
She put sheets on her bed.
I promise you I'll come early.
Tom can walk on his hands.
I am not as interested in literature as you.
How can you be so blind?
Who will come with me?
They're all watching TV.
You've made no allowance for the fact that he is young.
I was led by curiosity.
What's today's date?
Sign on this line.
A few of these are mine.
A small gain is better than a great loss.
Don't point your gun at anyone.
I don't have a cellphone.
Tom is in his sophomore year.
Do you have dinner plans?
Don't you think it's wonderful?
I don't think either of us wants that to happen.
The teacher suggested that we go to the library to study.
Let's get home.
Don't be upset.
How long will you remain in Boston?
I almost never do that.
You're so impatient.
The chicken is overcooked.
I told you so.
He is used to walking long distances.
I hear you know how to speak French.
People have to obey the rules.
I visited Australia a few years ago.
She aimed at the target.
I don't have a cellphone.
I think you're probably right.
I'm adaptable.
What do you think Tom told Mary?
It looks like you've regained your confidence.
Were you two close?
They're all lying.
This kind of weather makes me want to stay indoors.
I wish nothing but the best for you.
I thought Tom was still at home.
You touched my heart.
I can't believe you actually did that.
I want you to stay with me.
She wrote about it in her diary.
Tom is likely to be ready.
Some people are working in the fields.
I think you're the one who did that.
They're lucky to be alive.
Do you really want me to go?
Are you going to stay long?
How nice!
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Crime does not pay.
I'm truthful.
Let them know we're busy.
We have many purchases to make.
He's a smooth talker.
Who is the man that you were talking with?
His laziness is a bad sign for the future.
She's a tough one.
Maybe Tom was the one who stole your bicycle.
I thought I heard someone in the kitchen.
I get up at six every morning.
Tell me which one to choose.
Tom has his kids with him.
She got engaged to him.
You don't seem to be very tired.
Ask Tom to do that for you.
I have no more money in my wallet.
Did you visit the Tower of London?
Does that mean you'll stay?
Why not give us a chance?
You're not old enough to drive.
Tom looks sad.
What don't I understand?
He crashed his car because someone tampered with the brakes.
Ask me again in October.
We had fun with them.
Towns are larger than villages.
No amount of training can prepare you for this.
What're you doing?
This video is boring.
This desk cost three hundred dollars.
A plastic cup is better than one made of real glass.
It was a vase that my son broke last night.
Tom said that he was busy.
She woke up on her own.
You can call me anytime you like.
Can I see that?
I don't think we can guarantee your safety.
Can you save enough money for the down payment?
They arrived at the foot of the mountain.
I'm not a young man anymore.
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
He lived in a town near by.
She looks as if she were drunk.
I don't get out much.
The water turned to ice.
It looks like today will be a long day.
I don't see what else we can do.
The driver told us which bus we should take.
What does that even mean?
The post office is just past the bank.
There are no stupid questions.
Should I close?
I'm feeding the goldfish.
My friends don't pay attention to me anymore.
It's not easy to speak a foreign language.
Pets are allowed.
The airplane was flying above the clouds.
I am ashamed of your conduct.
Tom doesn't know if Mary is dead or alive.
You said you were busy.
I wasn't informed.
You're too trusting.
They'll never know.
It wasn't that big.
She called him every other day.
Could you explain it more simply?
Someone is watching Tom.
I lived in a small town.
Keep away from the dog.
Was there a scandal?
Stay away from my woman.
I'm not one to gossip.
I went by bus as far as London.
Did you understand me?
Everyone was fighting.
The old dog barked.
We're not going to answer any more questions.
I'm going to get home at about 2:30.
Tom told me Mary was busy.
The boy caught the cat by the tail.
I just thought you were happy.
You know where to find me.
The test was easy.
He reminds me of my grandfather.
I'm not a good liar.
I won't attend the party.
Will you shut up?
She thought that I was the doctor.
The train arrived in London.
I belong to the baseball team.
He is used to such situations.
I want to check it out.
He'll return at six.
What does that gentleman do for a living?
Why do you always do that to me?
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
Come down from the tree.
You look relaxed.
She tried to persuade him to buy her a pearl necklace.
It is forbidden for you to touch that switch.
I know you considered me a close friend.
Let me handle it.
We have to do something to help Tom.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
He prefers poetry to fiction.
Thank you for coming early.
I don't want to do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
Are you on the list?
How did you manage to do that?
We'll stay out of your way.
Let me do the talking.
We will be together forever.
Are you laughing at me?
Don't stay up too late.
What did you hide?
She looked all around.
Are you on dope?
The trip will take at least a week.
I'm applying for a job.
Be careful about what you eat.
Have a look.
His girlfriend is Japanese.
I need to get out of here.
Do you also like jazz?
I think you ought to postpone the meeting.
They went whale watching.
I think we need more food.
You're very sick.
I want to know what you're doing here.
My name's on the door.
There are downsides to being pretty.
What do you have to say about that?
Do you feel like eating?
People are looking at us.
You're not allowed to go into that room.
Tom came downstairs in his pajamas.
I don't have a bank account.
Stop being cruel.
We'll never get there in time.
Somebody's going to notice you.
I'd like to know the truth.
You're going too far.
The bus will be here in five minutes.
Someone stole my wallet.
The two teams fought very hard.
I was struck by lightning.
I'm not coming back here.
I paid thirty dollars for this book.
The court found him guilty.
This program is broadcast every other week.
Where exactly should I put this?
We've all seen that before.
I'll send you the link.
I took it for granted that you would come with us.
No one knows that.
He was named after his grandfather.
You're a very lucky man.
I'm not outgoing.
I can't hear you well.
I can't risk that.
It is worthwhile to read this book.
Put your pajamas on and go to bed.
I really need to sleep.
My car broke down on the way.
This one is on me.
My father is in the garden.
I was absent from school because I was sick.
You're on to something.
They made Tom an offer.
Look around you.
I'm busy getting ready for tomorrow.
They handled it well.
Any paper will do.
Further investigation is required.
I think we should get out here.
I cannot bring myself to do such a thing.
You can do it any way you like.
Thank you for the present you gave my son.
They're arguing.
Did you really dream about me?
I honestly think it's better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.
He visited his hometown for the first time in ten years.
That massage felt good.
He hasn't read the book yet.
This screw is loose.
Do you mind if I go back to sleep now?
It is utterly impossible to finish the work within a month.
You'd better try something else.
They're students.
It belongs to me now.
She helped cook lunch.
The official dinner took place at the White House.
I like coffee better.
Tom lives next door.
Can you ride a horse?
This is the most enjoyable thing I've ever done.
Tom and I aren't friends. We're just coworkers.
He was lying on the couch.
I found it necessary to get up early every morning.
I hope you're happy together.

I couldn't have said it better myself.
You're contradicting yourself.
I want you to take this with you.
It's a lot of fun to be with you.
That's really funny.
There was nobody there.
This bed looks solid.
You're overworked.
He plays soccer.

I know that Tom might want to learn how to do that.
The exercises did her good.
You leave me no choice.
We need to go.
Did they tell you why you had to do this?
He can't do that.
I've never been in love before.
I'll just leave.
I put my clothes in the dryer.
The weather report said that there will be thunderstorms tomorrow evening.
I've heard that many times.
You seem depressed.
No doubt she will win in the end.
You're not aiming high enough.
She still loves him.
I want to learn to play the guitar like you.
Do the police have any suspects?
Who told you I should do that?
Prince William is second in line to the English throne.
Give me my drink.
Would you excuse us one moment?
Tom didn't see it.
I wonder if someone could help me do this.
It is necessary for you to start at once.
I thought you'd want to see this movie.
How did you meet him?
What do you suggest?
I enjoy your company.
Tom decided that it wasn't necessary to pay that bill today.
I'm reading an interesting book.
Do you trust anyone?
I want to eat this.
I wonder if you could get me another beer.
She often goes to the movies with him.
I need a keyboard.
Do you want anything to eat?
Go on.
You must put an end to this foolish behavior.
I am thinking of my vacation.
I was unable to go outside.
There was no explosion.
His family did not have much money.
Are you satisfied with the result?
This is love.
Why do you not believe in God?
This is a long list.
Scorpions are dangerous.
Is there somebody you want to talk to?
Tom lost his fight with cancer.
You don't have to do what Tom says.
It's more complicated than I originally thought.
The tide is rising fast.
I could see that Tom was grinning.
Tom isn't as tall as I am.
She was playing with her sister at that time.
Tell me again how much money you have.
Tom began praying.
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?
Stop. You're making me blush.
When will you start?
His joke was great.
Why don't you go talk to him?
I guess my mind just wandered.
Tom asked the teacher some questions.
Do you accept credit cards?
It's because I love you.
Could you answer a question for me?
It's already eleven.
Aren't you in charge?
I'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots.
His word is law.
Stop beating around the bush.
It's good training.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
We need a medic.
You know that I'm married.
I haven't been successful.
This file is encrypted.
How much does this cost?
Are you retarded or something?
Everyone was looking at me.
I got up early today.
Their intimacy grew with the years.
I've got real feelings for you.
She pulled her sweater over her head.
Is this your bicycle?
The girl wearing the blue coat is my daughter.
You're the teacher.
Tom didn't understand the question.
Get on your bike.
We're careful.
I thought Tom was sick.
We're not stupid.
When did you notice that?
He is playing music.
Tom likes tofu.
He saw the girl.
I put it in the drawer.
I asked my boss for a pay raise.
I think he won't come.
I don't trust you anymore.
Tom put some food into the dog's dish.
I made that for you.
She must be very happy.
You have the necessary skills.
I knew you weren't really dead.
Can you hear me?
I can't believe we've finally finished the project.
I thought this was important.
How much were you paid to say that?
We'll deal with it in the morning.
I didn't tell him you were coming.
I don't think we're going to be able to do that.
Why's everyone whispering?
The rest doesn't matter.
I should've warned you.
She couldn't convince him to go home.
She rents a room to a student.
I believe you.
Tom didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
Her dream is to visit Paris.
Is this a wine?
I have something in my suitcase for you.
You're weird.
You're not a millionaire.
The sky is full of dark clouds.
I know what we can do.
Tom's eyes were full of tears.
I should do it.
What was the cause of the explosion?
Let's begin our work at once.
Get on with it.
Let me show you how we do that.
We all cried.
Eleven is a prime number.
It's at the corner.
I lied to the police.
She helped him.
Don't rub it in.
I never oversleep.
There wasn't any special hurry.
Don't be scared to meet new people.
I can't read your mind.
You have to judge the case without bias.
I really like your music.
I'll open the box and see what's in it.
Are you going or staying?
The person responsible has been fired.
Have your paper on my desk by Monday.
She went into the room and lay on the bed.
I'm going to stay there for about a week.
I'll be happy to work with you.
What did you see?
May I use your toilet?
Your car's on fire.
Tom is always here on Mondays.
I said I'm fine.
I weighed myself on the bathroom scales.
Does this sentence make sense?
Mary said Tom was in trouble.
I should have been watching more carefully.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
Tell me why you think that.
I wonder where she lives.
Were you born here?
Let them take care of themselves.
You're the sweetest.
Tom's parents are teachers.
We should not put restrictions on foreign trade.
He ordered a chop suey.
It takes a thief to catch a thief.
She would often play tricks on me.
It wasn't so hard to do that.
There was a tape recorder on the table.
I can't give it up.
The group was made up of six girls and four guys.
What did the other guy look like?
This kind of thing usually takes a long time.
They all deserve to die.
Do we need an universal language?
Did you tell Tom why you're here?
I need to borrow your car.
She is a short story writer.
Is he sleeping?
Were you born there?
You can take your time.
He gets angry if he's contradicted.
Try to act naturally.
What do you think I should pack for my trip?
I'm sorry for not being more supportive when you needed me to be.
I wonder if exchange students can join this club.
I did no such thing.
You must do as I say.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
The skin is the largest organ of the body.
Tom wants to stay.
We know each other.
I met him about noon.
Were you even tempted?
How do I get to the zoo?
I've never had a friend quite like you.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Tom is eager to live in Boston.
You've changed since I saw you last year.
This isn't the time or the place to do that.
I'm a detective.
Are you in Paris?
Please make yourself at home.
Tom always asks for permission before he borrows my bicycle.
I wanna quit my job.
She argued with him about money.
I won't do anything.
Tom is three years older than you.
I am very pleased with my new house.
I'm allowed to do anything I want to do.
Do you think Tom saw us?
Don't try doing two things at the same time.
Silence isn't always good.
I'll be back by six o'clock.
The whole crew was saved.
I didn't want to spend any more time in jail.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Did you see the transcript?
I still make a lot of mistakes.
Tell me which one to choose.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
You don't know anything.
This needs to change.
I like yellow.
Keep focused on your work.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
What's that thing you have in your hand?
Stand where you are or I'll kill you.
I didn't know what was happening.
I believe it's my duty to protect these children.
She likes the teacher.
Do you really think it's impossible?
They will debate the question tomorrow.
I understood what you meant.
He's a bit naive.
It's a quarter to two.
No one saw that.
I don't doubt your intentions.
You should brush your teeth after every meal.
Tom stole all of Mary's money.
I deserved better.
Tom should have done things differently.
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
I figured you might want this.
Did I give you enough time?
I told you that was just a joke.
Can I go first?
They can't fire you.
I'm out of ideas.
Do I have to change my diet?
I thought you might need some help getting ready for your wedding.
I'm not going to name names.
Dr. Hideo Noguchi died in Africa in 1928.
I did try to warn you.
It was through his influence that she became interested in ecology.
How many people do you think we should invite to our party?
I'd like to ask you to help me.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
I'm very happy to be back home.
What did Tom answer?
Tom insisted.
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
We want a new carpet.
She told him a joke.
I don't care what you thought.
I have made many mistakes in my lifetime.
I filled in the blanks.
You must have seen them there.
We got off on the wrong foot.
He is absent because of illness.
Do you guys like white wine?
Tom doesn't earn enough money to support a family.
Tom ought to stop doing that.
We should work faster.
I do not trust him any longer.
Here is a letter for you.
I don't want to talk to you about this.
I hope your brother is better.
Tom insisted that he acted alone.
We know what to do next.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Someone is lying.
Run for it!
The offer is too good to turn down.
I thought that you'd understand.
That's all I want.
I think it's wonderful.
I'd rather stay home if it's all the same to you.
You must be out of your mind.
I don't read newspapers much.
I heard that.
Do you know who that person is?
He wasn't there last week.
It's really stressful.
What foods are you allergic to?
Did you actually see it?
Come home early.
Tom and Mary were eating in silence.
Is anybody ready for dessert?
Let go of the handle.
I don't know how to explain it.
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
You seem like a very smart person.
I just want to be near you.
Tom poured some cereal into a bowl.
Stay right where you are.
My phone has a caller ID that lets me screen my calls.
Are you proud of yourself?
He did the unthinkable.
Murder is punished by death.
Let's talk to Tom about that.
Tom said Mary was happy.
Tom is way older than Mary.
I go to church every Sunday.
What do I have to do to convince you?
That's all I can promise.
My house looks to the south.
It's interesting.
I'd like a piece of cheese.
I have a runny nose.
Let me see it.
Please have someone else do it.
No way!
She has brought up five children.
I'll be glad when it's over.
We finally arrived at the lake.
I'm not leaving the two of you alone.
Can I ask you something personal?
How long do you plan on staying here?
I don't understand the analogy.
I know what not to eat.
I want to see you in your office in half an hour.
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
Don't fix it if it ain't broke.
I think my plan is better than yours.
That was mentioned.
The result remains to be seen.
She is going to wash the bike this afternoon.
I'm not disagreeing.
We don't have the time.
How long were you alone with Tom?
You have made a promise.
I have taught my dog to sit up and beg.
I think that's a problem.
Who is in charge of the office while the boss is away?
I just can't figure it out.
I think you'd better tell us the truth.
My hair is as long as Tom's.
The structural integrity of the building is compromised.
Both of my parents can't swim.
Her eyes were red from crying.
How do you spell that word?
I thought that things would change.
My wife wanted to adopt a child.
He sat next to her.
Tom has been smiling all day.
Where's your dog?
I'm not old enough.
You don't look very well. Are you sick?
She was homesick.
Bring me a chair.
Speak into the microphone.
I like milk.
Did you live here before?
Ice skating can be graceful and beautiful.
Enthusiasm is contagious.
I gave her my word I would be back home by nine.
You're such an idiot!
Place the ladder against the wall.
How long did this take?
He remained single all his life.
I go to the beach almost every day.
She availed herself of every opportunity to improve her English.
I'm well acquainted with Tom.
How's your new job?
He deserves the punishment.
I'd like to be in a band.
He failed the entrance exam.
Don't take it personally.
You should take the time to do that.
Stop being cruel.
Could we get a bottle of your best champagne?
I don't take any medication.
She would not follow my advice.
I never saw Tom before today.
No one has come forward to claim responsibility for what happened.
I have no reason to lie to you.
I miss my friends.
Don't fish in this river. It's prohibited.
I'll be right there.
How long are they?
I feel like I know you already.
You might be interested in this.
Nothing will change.
Is everything satisfactory?
How do you know I'm not the one who did it?
Do you like beer?
We are not amused.
I guess you'll need some help.
I was playing the violin.
I wish I had a camera.
I'm getting used to it.
I'll make you proud of me.
It doesn't rain here very often.
It is time I left here.
Tom's death has been officially ruled as an accident.
I think you look hot.
He left me the keys.
Don't be fooled by her appearance.
I dream about you quite often.
Don't forget to call your parents.
Don't be so pessimistic.
You're nuts!
It's a tremendous deal.
You have only to push this button.
Don't be sorry.
It was love at first sight.
Tom seems to be motivated.
Where were you at 2:30 on Monday afternoon?
We should consider the problem from a child's perspective.
I urgently need to go to the bathroom.
Tom did nothing illegal.
I stayed home this summer.
He was burning up with fever.
I have to take an exam.
You're the only one who can help me.
You should be proud of yourself.
It was your own choice.
I wasn't able to remember the title of that song.
You were removed from the list.
We've got to get you out of here.
Listen closely.
Tom opened a window.
There's almost no water in the bucket.
He is a potential world champion.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
You can get rid of the cold if you take this medicine.
Flags of the world fly proudly at the United Nations headquarters.
They manage to get along without much money.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
I think my mom knows.
We helped them out when we could.
I think Tom is loyal.
A bad habit is easily acquired.
Am I on the right road?
You said it wasn't going to happen.
Thanks a million.
Tom decided to call the police.
You're very good.
The cat was basking in the sun.
I will wait outside.
It's my job.
We're going inside.
I'm a little scared.
I've never considered it.
He was the first to help her.
My wife's hands are slightly smaller than the shop assistant's.
He doesn't have any real friends.
Here is a list of moderately priced restaurants.
Don't ever lie to me again.
Almost everybody was invited.
What is critical thinking?
Have you met everyone here?
Tell Tom it's an emergency.
What's making you uneasy?
Give me something to eat.
Please write down your name.
Did we make a huge mistake?
Don't you remember anything?
I can talk to him for hours.
That will buy us time.
The unexpected always happens.
Keep your hands up.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
I'm going to do that on Monday.
The old man is always accompanied by his grandson.
I am not wearing any underwear.
Were you busy?
I'm no longer tired.
Can you stay for a while?
Tom was homeschooled.
When do we start?
We are good friends.
They can't hear you.
No one had anything left to say.
He didn't know what to do with the extra food.
You don't want to be late for practice.
You are my hero.
What a beautiful city!
I read the newspaper every day when I was in college.
You look very tired.
I don't see this as a core issue.
What's the purpose of your visit?
The doors lock automatically.
We're investigating the murder of Tom Jackson.
Why don't you stay a minute?
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
Tom doesn't live with his wife anymore.
Can you read what's written on the blackboard?
What floor do you live on?
Let us help you do that.
I'm on parole.
Tom is an unemployed security guard.
There is little water left.
I'm not nervous at all.
I'm easygoing.
She met the man of her dreams.
Keep your eyes open.
My pride prevented me from borrowing money from him.
Speak up!
I'm going to give you one more chance.
I don't have the authority.
She studies hard.
I like what you've done with this place.
I saw them.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Her genius makes up for her lack of experience.
He couldn't go out because of the snow.
I always buy expensive items on credit.
Did I tell you that already?
We had a fight.
Tom stayed in Boston a few days.
That is the book I want to read.
You lost.
What's this?
Where is the difference?
I don't think I have what it takes to be a teacher.
Look at the picture at the top of the page.
I got to the bus stop just after the bus had left.
Your tire is flat.
This is just water.
I don't think I want to answer any more of your questions right now.
Have a drink.
The youth was arrested for being involved in a riot.
Watch closely.
I will do everything within my power to help you.
You must perform your duty.
We hang out together all the time.
Tom and Mary have been trying to come up with a solution to the problem.
I don't like it when you do that.
Smoke appeared.
Her ambition is to become an ambassador.
You take your job too seriously.
The economy of Japan is still stable.
I gave him a call.
Things were different in those days.
It was a coincidence.
They're all dead.
Why are you being so negative?
I don't know how this works.
Do you hate me?
What time did the meeting end?
You need to let me handle this.
Disneyland was very interesting. You should've come with us.
I don't deny this.
I haven't paid for the tickets yet.
Hand me a tissue.
I won't be getting married this year.
The boy was sold into slavery.
Why are you flinching?
How annoying!
This is a very old photo.
Has anybody here been to Hawaii?
It's a new book.
I think you look fine.
It was raining last night.
I've already rescheduled my appointment twice.
I hate Halloween.

How are you?
I want us not to get caught.
Put it on the wall.
Thanks to both of you.
I didn't have enough time to eat everything that was served.
We associate the name of Einstein with the theory of relativity.

Tom bought a very good camera.
I just thought you were happy.
He listened to the news on the radio as he fed his dog.
I wish Tom was here.
I've told you everything I know about Tom.
I'll take care of this.
I made friends with them at the school festival.
What book did you buy?
We don't need to do that today.
You're very nice.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
He knows what's going on.
Don't knock it unless you try it first.
He seems to be friendly.
It looks like we didn't understand him.
I gave it a shot.
Why does Tom always look so tired?
Can you give me Tom's address?
He told us a very exciting adventure story.
You heard correctly.
AI means Artificial Intelligence.
We broke up.
He is a capable lawyer.
I used my imagination.
I'm selling my car.
Please don't laugh at me.
He's fresh out of college.
It may rain this afternoon.
I will take such action as seems necessary.
I feel like taking a day off tomorrow.
Nobody is forcing you to do this.
Tom couldn't go to the concert because he had to work.
I don't want to be tied to one company.
They're really tight.
I will give you a bike for your birthday.
I've got to do this.
All you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
His anger towards me has not softened.
I stayed up all night.
I can buy one.
Are you sure?
I'd prefer that you stay home tonight.
You need to press the button.
Do you have a copy?
Tom likes to drink wine.
Stand where you are or I'll kill you.
What are you here for?
It had snowed.
You'll get used to it one day.
We met each other at a party.
I really like that.
I believe you know what I mean.

This is the perfect Father's Day gift.
My mom is overprotective.
Her beauty will fade in time.
He is close to sixty.
Why does everyone think I'm stupid?
He gave me some money.
I go to any party I am invited to.
I shook my head and said no.
That might not be easy.
His doctor ordered him to rest.
He kept me waiting.
I think he likes you.
It gave me quite a shock.
She was there in the morning.
This is a hospital.
Why don't you go talk to him?
We sat in the very back of the auditorium.
I always thought you'd make a cute couple.
I can't promise anything.
I'm no friend of yours.
You're very wise.
What do you really mean?
I thought you were asleep.
I'm going to prison.
I regret going there.
I do have one request.
Let me use your computer.
Everyone felt safe.
Nothing is planned.
Slaves did most of the work.
I like what you did with your hair.
It's not weird.
Tom speaks French much better than Mary does.
It's a sequel.
It was the increase in population that caused the poverty.
You didn't finish filling out this form.
I'm glad people saw it.
I only need one thing.
Do you want to hear my story or not?
Keep me apprised of any further developments.
Is this drinking water?
I feel the need to do something different today.
A mighty cheer burst from the crowd.
He ordered me to sweep the room.
I had him fix my watch.
Tom cried all morning.
I was glad that I could help.
You should have done so.
It is about the size of an egg.
He is alert to every chance of making money.
You look great in these photos.
I'm often mistaken for my brother.
Why did it have to be me?
That was his catchphrase.
We used emergency measures to revive the cardiac arrest patient.

Raise your hand if you know the answer.
The man standing over there is the owner of the store.
I'd like to buy a good dictionary.

He dumped me.
I have no way of knowing that.
He was sitting in the library when I saw him.
She talked on and on about her family problems.
I heard an unusual noise.
Are you tired?
An earthquake can happen at any time.
Don't let him do it alone.
We're leaving tonight.
I need an escort.
A rush-hour traffic jam delayed my arrival by two hours.
Run for it!
I'm eating beans.
The police were suspicious of his movements.
I can't believe I didn't think of it.
I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation.
Have you finished talking?
I visited my grandmother's house.
He told me that you were right.
What makes you think I don't like your friends?
Do you know why?
What makes you think I'm not happy?
I hope I'm not bothering anybody.
Tom signed the document.
Defense lawyers appealed for mercy.
I'm busy.
Does Tom have to be present?
Do you want to go?
Industrialization often goes hand in hand with pollution.
I haven't told anyone.
She declined to say more about it.
I will see to it that everything is ready in time.
He's your father.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you cry.
Are you ready for the trip?
He is swimming in the pool.
The apple trees blossomed early this year.
Did you get the check?
Kyoto has many places to see.
She wouldn't give him a gift.
Come in.
He can't be young.
The people are friendly here.
That's good enough.
I had business to take care of.
She must be visiting England this summer.
Are you questioning my judgment?
Where did the money go?
It hurts so much.
I was really young when I met you.
Please read after me.
Tom isn't rich.
I've been all over the world.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
It's not a classroom.
Let's live here.
This is life!
Speak quietly.
I don't like this anymore.
I need to get some shuteye.
Tom sold his house in Boston.
You do like living dangerously.
I want an MP3 player!
When will you leave?
There was an explosion in the lab.
He became a famous singer.
Let's get off the bus.
I warned him of the danger.
Everyone is proud of you.
Try to go slower.
I was offended.
Time is more precious than anything else.
The company went bankrupt.
This dog can jump very high.
I'll lend it to you.
You got here too early.
I'm not against outlawing guns.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
What's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?
His body was covered with brown fur.
I am going to that place.
Tom already knows how to read.
Lay it on the table.
I'm surprised Tom won.
Do you have anything to add?
Do you want some cherry pie?
I caught them in the act.
I'd like to see you this afternoon.
I'm eating lunch.
They were punished for their crimes.
I've been looking for it all morning.
I bought a new camera.
The team was quite nervous before the game.
I hate karaoke.
I paid for these tickets.
Which newspaper do you read?
I need this job.
I feel silly.
That's it for today.
You remind me of a boy I used to know.
I need to unlock this door.
Are you sure you don't want to keep it?
You should go home.
I really didn't care.
I don't even remember it.
This is not a game.
Don't you always do what's expected?
That's all nonsense.
This train runs between Tokyo and Osaka.
That's exactly my point.
You're still green.
"Why are you angry? ""I'm not angry!"""
Was there something you wanted to tell me?
I wonder whether Tom is really serious.
Here it is.
It was ages ago.
I'm your friend.
I have an ear infection.
That must be hard.
Go get it.
No one will speak with me.
They were perfect.
Tom could swim when he was three years old.
She has a book under her arm.
Who is your teacher?
Have you ever served as a witness in a court case?
The car stalled because you didn't step on the clutch.
She taught the child never to play with matches.
Lemons are sour.
I'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots.
How did you lose your arm?
I don't need a break.
I'm good at cooking.
I love Christmas songs.
I didn't win.
I would very much appreciate receiving a copy of the book.
Have you ever been kissed before?
You should quit gambling.
There's someone hiding in the closet.
I really like what I do.
I'm not leaving the two of you alone.
It was too soft.
A fox is a wild animal.
Please call me back.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
I wonder what all of them have in common.
I amused myself.
You've got a one-track mind.
I'll make a pot of coffee.
Tom's not a bad guy.
May I open the door?
We stopped for lunch at a local restaurant.
She was advised by him to be punctual.
I would really like to explore this cave.
I wanted to talk with Tom.
Tom planted three apple trees in his yard.
Don't ask me such a hard question.
The truth finally came out at his trial.
People no longer consider it strange for men to let their hair grow long.
Many people spend more than they earn.
Are you deaf?
The restaurant is empty.
Here is your key.
What would you like for dessert?
We were really excited.
The outdoor concert was canceled due to the storm.
I figured that you'd probably never want to see me again.
I'm the surgeon.
I still enjoy that.
I'd like to say a few words.
I am the laziest person I know.
More and more Americans go abroad.
I did everything in my power to protect her from you.
Take this to your mother.
He's now short of money.
You can't park your car here.
I didn't know they could do that.
You are very attractive in blue.
I think I'm ready to leave.
Hang on. We'll be right there.
I'm glad you brought that up.
I tested everything.
I'd like to ask you about a car you repaired.
Let's do it!
I wonder whether I could help Tom.
It is a pity that you can't join us.
I know that you're coming.
We're almost there.
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
I ran into an old friend of mine at the party the other day.
I'm glad you invited me to your party.
The magician had the children's attention.
Dentists take x-rays to examine your teeth.
You have many books.
I think she's forty.
Let's go camping.
They're downstairs.
What was your father's name?
I would never do it again.
Tom closed the blinds.
A bee flew out of the window.
They won't find it.
They left the problem unsolved.
I think Tom got scared.
This is all there is.
I did it without consulting anyone.
I'd like to know what this is all about.
Why didn't you just leave?
Where was Tom born?
It's my job.
English is also studied in China.
I assume your mission was a success.
Have you ever had a long distance relationship?
I made a big mistake.
Tom is speaking.
I demand punctuality.
You know I love you!
They're all hungry.
I swim here every morning.
I'd like a glass of water.
Do you own a computer?
Everybody was stunned.
I just don't feel that way about you.
Defend yourself.
He was shot to death.
Tom is always lying.
Who can help me?
I would just like to thank all of you for your work.
I don't like your attitude.
You're too loud.
I like the new guy. He's not afraid to take on challenging work.
You don't have to come see me.
This apple tastes very sour.
I'm calm.
Do you eat meat?
Are you ready for today's game?
I just wanted to talk to you.
I'd rather not talk about it here.
He did the best he could.
I suggested that we bring the meeting to an end.
Everyone working for us earns more than the minimum wage.
I'd like to be alone.
Tom said he regretted not following Mary's advice.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
He took no notice of our warning.
You must not give up.
They play together a lot.
Should we go by car or by taxi?
You don't have to tell me his name.
We're stunned.
No one I know can afford to eat out anymore.
Monopoly is a popular game for families to play.
I didn't flunk.
Do we have to take the bus?
I visited the town for the first time in a long time.
Are you leaving tomorrow?
How do you relax after work?
I was a criminal.
It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
I wonder where Tom hid his key.
You should do it.
We see what we expect to see.
Why can't I hear?
I'm going to enjoy this.
I grew up around here.
They knew exactly how much of a risk they'd be taking.
I can't thank you enough for the help you've given me.
I was too fast.
He was trembling with rage.
He was given up for dead.
Tom ate all of the chocolate.
Speaking English is useful.
Get dressed quickly.
Fight like men.
Where's Tom?
That's my best guess.
You can say whatever you want.
We don't have tea.
I picked you some flowers.
There's something I wanted to give you.
I got lost on my way here.
I need my key.
I'm very strict.
She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.
Let me take a gander.
I saw your father.
It happened that the day was my birthday.
How about going out for dinner?
The result was rather disappointing.
The fire was so intense that the firemen couldn't get into the house.
She advised him to drink more milk.
They were naive.
Mary took her necklace off.
Here are some letters for you.
It's good enough.
Our teacher sometimes speaks too fast.
What's so strange about that?
Bring a shovel.
This is a lion.
Were you awake at 2:30 last night?
I'm ready when you are.
Did you have a lot of happy experiences in your childhood?
I told everybody about what happened.
I told you I could help you.
He is proud of his collection.
I made him carry the suitcase.
Keep calm.
We walked around the pond.
He said it as a joke.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
I gave you what you wanted.
It was so cold that we made a fire.
Would you like to go out for a drink after work?
This is yours.
We'll need a lot of help.
Have you ever been in love?
I hate it when you do that.
Are you envious?
I burned them.
You say you want to go to Boston? Why in the world would you want to go there?
The entire city was without electricity.
When did you build your house?
What's it smell like?
How much further do we have to go?
Leave it closed.
Everyone thinks we're a couple.
Money is not a criterion of success.
He makes a point of doing ten push-ups before going to bed.
The library will issue you a library card.
What are you drinking?
I'm not easily impressed.
I couldn't lie to you.
Tom doesn't know where Mary usually goes skiing.
We baked it together.
You have something of a reputation.
They're disposable.
I feel kind of tired.
You know this isn't necessary.
This is my money.
He needs to be the center of attention.
We're as good as dead now.
Which book do you need?
No one knows me like you do.
You have to hold back.
It is easy to answer the question.
I can swim.
The cook put the food in the dumb waiter.
I have no one else to turn to.
She hired him as an interpreter because she had heard that he was the best.
A woman appeared from behind a tree.
You don't have to apologize.
I don't do this for the money.
The president is difficult to approach.
Tom's harmless.
I can't understand the meaning of this word.
Tom walked out of the room.
I'd better go to bed now.
This isn't your office.
Do you know anything?
I never had a steady job.
He donated countless pieces to the museum.
I feel a little awkward.
He had gone there to help garbage workers strike peacefully for better pay and working conditions.
I write in my diary every day.
Have you ever been on TV?
Make your move.
The defendant was found not guilty by reason of insanity.
The weather is very cold in Istanbul.
There is an urgent message for you.
Our boss approved our plan.
I don't understand why you're leaving.
Please read the text below.
Don't you think that's a bit weird?
Don't underestimate my power.
A friend to everybody is a friend to nobody.
Thanks for saving me.
I climbed in through the window.
Schools are closed for Christmas.
He rested for a while.
You're funny.
I enjoyed swimming in the river.
An important function of policemen is to catch thieves.
Don't you want a little excitement?
The teacher can see you.
May I go first?
She gave me good advice.
Just do what you want.
Tom won't leave until he's talked to Mary.
He was perfect.
We must succeed.
I was tired today.
He hesitated before answering.
I don't have a clue.
Are you almost ready?
I don't want to go swimming with you.
Do you think there's something wrong with me?
Have you read that book?
Forget I said anything.
He loves music.
Her daughter has become a beautiful woman.
This will be one of the best memories of my life.
Have you read Tom's book?
Are you sure that's safe?
Nice timing.
Education is an investment in the future.
Did I miss something?
Is everybody ready for the trip?
A hexagon has six sides.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
I want to buy ski boots.
She is good-natured.
I don't feel like drinking vodka.
She kissed him on the cheek.
Tom lost hope.
They arranged a meeting.
I thought you said we weren't going to complain anymore.
Do you play any instruments?
Tom told me not to say anything to you.
We all have kids.
Tom lied about a lot of things.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I'd like to thank you for helping me translate the report into French.
We all die.
You can't separate language from culture.
Look me in the eyes and tell me you didn't do it.
I've made up my mind to learn how to play the harp.
I bought a house.
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
She began to sweat.
I didn't know you could cook.
How did I miss this?
They forced him to tell the truth.
What're you doing in this park?
Perhaps we should talk in my office.
It's for my friend.
She agreed to my idea.
I just wanted to try it once.
Tom'll call.
Stop playing hard to get.
I sure am glad you weren't hurt.
What's in this box?
Who are you working for?
Tom should've invited Mary.
How could you agree to doing that without consulting me?
That's certainly possible.
The spy made contact with the enemy.
She scolded him.
We baked it together.
Tom owns a very profitable company.
I can barely stand up.
You've done a lot already.
I had a bladder infection last month.
I believe you can help us.
It was a beautiful night.
Do you have anything to eat in your pack?
It hasn't been done before.
The engine started again.
I have something of yours.
The other one doesn't work.
We're going to protect you.
All the tickets are sold out.
Are you going to sing with us?
He's done it before.
Are your parents home?
He spends his evenings in front of his laptop.
We should help.
Enjoy your evening.
Have you heard anything about the organization?
The allegations they made were unfounded.
Were you followed?
He was talking nonsense.
Are you healthy?
Several students came to the library.
She allowed me to go.
There is often fog in the morning.
I'll show you around the city.
He drove the truck to Dallas.
His dog barks at me.
They're out to get you.
I'm reading the newspaper.
She is a beauty.
This is the best party I've been to all year.
They lost again.
I'm pretty sure that this is Tom's umbrella.
I have a heart problem.
He was re-elected mayor.
They are all the same.
I don't believe it.
I don't think that I'll go today.
I know you're not lying.
You look great.
I had to climb over the wall.
English is spoken all over the world.
What time do you wake up?
Barking dogs seldom bite.
Let's talk about your childhood.
My aunt grows tomatoes in her garden.
I used to write in my diary every day when I was young.
Can I ask you for a favor?
Why were you so slow?
Are you trying to scare me?
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
I wonder if we could talk.
I think we should break up.
I usually eat lunch by myself.
Did she say that?
I don't need your praise.
Are you happy with that?
Tom just told his wife that he was leaving her.
He was sent to prison.
This is not funny.
Tom was the only one who laughed.
I know Tom will want it.
What more do we need to make us happy?
They crashed.
The hotel is run by his uncle.
Can we have a moment alone?
The job is almost finished.
It's for your own safety.
Neither of us could've done that alone.
We traveled together.
I wish my father had lived longer.
Where did you meet your girlfriend?
We should do our best.
We'll get in touch with you.
I haven't played tennis in years.
My GPS works very well.
Tom's plan is perfect.
The Smiths are our neighbors.
She lived with him all her life.
It was very hard for her to suppress her emotions.
Some animals eat their young.
I don't want to go back there.
You should have your eyes examined.
It doesn't look right.
Some people questioned his honesty.
Tom was lucky to find his keys.
His girlfriend did it for him.
This one is ours.
I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.
I may have seen that girl somewhere.
Did you do what I asked?
Take two of these red pills.
Some people still believe that the world is flat.
We need you to be strong.
When did you come?
She met him on the beach.
What did you say your name was?
He will have to go to the station.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
I was captured.
Tom is special.
That might happen on Monday.
I haven't talked to anyone lately.
You still haven't told me who he is.
I don't get the joke.
I'll call you in a couple of days.
We shouldn't be on the list.
Aren't you embarrassed?
You can do better than that.
I am delighted to be here.
I want to make sure we have enough water.
I'd like to give you something.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
I face a dilemma.
He doesn't believe in God.
Purchase any necessary articles quickly.
You came at just the right time.
That's a lie.
I can't tell you what we ended up doing.
Tom helped the teacher decorate the classroom for Valentine's Day.
That job gave him little gratification.
It's a sunflower.
Great minds think alike.
I'm surprised to see you.
I didn't know that you needed to do that.
Look at this picture.
My uncle gave his car to me.
I'd love to dance with you.
I don't want it.
You sound tired.
I feel bad that I haven't paid you yet.
It was pitch-black.
I can't just kick Tom out.
Where were you when the fire occurred?
Franois has a good idea.
Be objective.
She cursed him for forgetting his promise.
I had such a happy childhood.
He is very mean to me.
Are we being charged with something?
I just want to go home and see my wife and the kids.
I had to do everything on my own.
She called for help.
You couldn't have picked a better spot.
You're going to have to deal with that.
We took part in the discussion.
Tom had a bandage on his left hand.
It's none of your business.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I did it myself.
We'll miss living in Boston.
She isn't good enough for him.
He wants you to come home.
They had several children.
That would be hard.
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness.
I know I've been acting strangely.
I have no friends.
Exceptions prove the rule.
Tom speaks French much better than he speaks English.
They were taken prisoner.
Tom has been bitten by a stray dog.
I never wear a hat.
It's your responsibility to finish the job.
I thought she was sick.
Circumstances did not permit me to help you.
A fire broke out last night and three houses were burnt down.
It's your responsibility to do that.
I don't like that kind of woman.
I gave my father a silk tie.
She talked to the chairman.
There was a light rain yesterday.
When will we leave?
She dressed herself quickly.
Tom is very incompetent.
No one can do it but you.
What are you reading?
There are no further details.
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow.
Tom listened with interest.
I will come earlier next time.
I knew I was making mistakes.
What does this word mean?
She tried to conceal her grief at the party.
I really am interested.
This shop carries men's clothing.
This rule does not apply to the case.
They basked in the sun.
Everything worked fine.
That almost sounds like a threat.
I tried to talk a friend of mine out of getting married.
Do you want to see the list?
I wish I were a bird.
The kitchen is downstairs.
I have so many things I want you to know.
He knows how to captivate his audience.
How often do you brush your teeth?
Let's do it!
Cheers!
Where did you get it?
I'm surprised that Tom can't speak French.
I forgot my wallet.
I don't want your gold.
He wants a watch just like yours.
She looked at me in amusement.
Could you move just a little closer?
Don't come to me with any excuses.
I know you're going to say no.
Can you keep a secret?
I never drink wine.
I'll be going.
Tom has another job.
I felt my heart beating violently.
What are you going to do today?
Are there enough chairs?
I'm glad to have this opportunity to work with you.
Everyone is against me.
You'd love it.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
Please choose wisely.
I spent the whole week working on that report.
Hi.
She is not so much a singer as a comedian.
Tell Tom that I'm exhausted.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
The old man attempted to swim five kilometers.
I'd like to have you on our team.
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
I don't like hot tubs.
Can I have a bit more milk?
Make up your own mind.
I need a pen.
This carpet is beautiful.
I have only just begun.
Do you have a mobile phone?
Why did you buy the flowers?
We need to buy a new washing machine.
I can't believe you actually said that.
I slept in front of the TV.
She worships him.
I wholeheartedly agree.
It's all right.
Do you really enjoy doing that kind of thing?
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench.
That boy won't tell me his name.
Didn't they teach you anything at Harvard?
I knew you'd be here.
Why didn't you call me last night?
Tom won't mind.
What are you looking for?
Let me know what you want to do.
I don't have to put up with this.
I don't know if I can do this.
Is eating a clove of garlic every day beneficial to your health?
I know there are others.
I did it just now.
I'm looking for my cellphone.
We have enough.
I want to discuss a very important matter with you.
I'm smarter than you.
You amuse me.
I'm glad I invited you.
Heaven knows we've done everything we can.
He wants to participate in the contest.
She takes care of my children.
Have I convinced you?
You don't seem to be very tired.
I'm glad you're here today.
I study at school.
I don't bite.
This story is far more interesting than that one.
You shouldn't share too much private information on the social networks.
Cats are smart.
She's adorable.
Is this wine from Argentina?
You're thirty thousand dollars in debt.
What was wrong with them?
He was shown the photo by her.
Was that you in the car?
She's open-minded.
Have you ever argued with your parents?
How much farther do we have to go?
Did you catch the first train?
I'm fascinated.
My sister is suffering from a bad cold.
I don't suppose you ever really get over the death of a child.
My husband and daughter are fast asleep.
Write with a ballpoint pen.
I hope you're right.
Is he a teacher?
Tom saw Mary earlier this week.
You're very brave.
This movie is really scary.
I'll be ready in a few minutes.
I don't know how to reach you.
Anywhere with a bed will do.
You're the one who quit.
How can you even ask that question?
I am ready to do anything for you.
Are you in good shape?
We'll protect you.
I heard a noise upstairs.
He acted like he owned the place.
Are you traveling alone?
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
It was boring.
Get out of here! I'll do it myself.
This isn't what I ordered.
You're not fired.
Where do you think we came from?
Cookie is a good name for a dog.
I asked him to drive me home.
They slept in the same room.
None of the money is yours.
We had a real good time.
What did you say?
I really want to understand.
Drinking warm milk makes me sleepy.
Don't panic!
You may talk as much as you like.
Tom was afraid to go back home.
Here is your bag.
May I be excused?
You may use my dictionary.
Brush your teeth after each meal.
I have nothing to declare.
When's Tom arriving?
Who do you know here?
I don't need you to wait for me.
You're a good liar.
He took part in the race.
I knew every one of those guys.
I watched the whole thing.
Her windows were broken and her shutters hung crookedly.
Tom is as good a cook as his father.
You must think I'm really strange.
Where do we know each other from?
I refuse to be ignored any longer.
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth.
It might snow tonight.
The doctor told Tom to stop eating dog food.
I just don't believe it.
She complained that the picture was too revealing.
Tom looked at the floor.
I'm a bit hungry.
Tom said I looked unhappy.
Why should we bother trying to fix it?
I love the way you kiss.
I thought you were going to wait for me.
Where do you want us to go?
He crossed the street.
I enjoy working here a lot.
Let's start with the basics.
My mother made me a sweater.
We want to take your blood pressure.
They're similar.
Did you enjoy the party yesterday?
Tom told me that the book was interesting.
What are your plans for this weekend?
I can't believe he kissed you.
He said it as a joke.
I didn't have time to read.
You're no longer welcome in my house.
I'm bluffing.
You nearly died.
It's still too early to talk about this now.
I'm glad you invited me to your party.
My brother has a gift for painting.
I chose not to leave.
Tom likes to travel alone.
I don't think I'll be needing anything else.
Can you give me another pillow?
Anything you say can be used against you.
Tom is in the ski lodge.
He fought until the end.
I think this is the wrong key.
I don't like being surprised.
The telephone doesn't work.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you've come to visit us.
We must cut down our expenses.
I found him the book.
The elevator stopped on the second floor.
I didn't enjoy the party at all.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
I have to say no.
You look wonderful tonight.
Fill the tires with air.
It's rather impressive.
I haven't told anybody else.
He is mentally handicapped.
How much does she need?
I met an American who was interested in Noh plays.
That wasn't part of the plan.
They're taking Mary to the emergency room.
That's what I asked for.
This suitcase is too heavy for you.
I've been threatened.
Don't give up on your dreams.
Tom said that.
He fed his dog at the same time every day.
He did it the way I told him to.
We kept our word.
Are you having fun?
I didn't get any of that.
He tried harder to get good marks than I did.
I can't figure this out.
My sister is a twenty-one years old college student.
That is my school.
I think Tom knows more than he's admitting.
These bottles are empty.
That rich family has many servants.
You don't have the time.
The water was cold.
He was sitting there.
I can hear everything.
I thought you'd like it.
Put it on the wall.
I'm managing.
He couldn't help laughing at it.
Are those your daughters?
I wasn't sure where I belonged.
Tom may not wait any longer.
Do you want me to call back?
Tom needed more time to finish his work.
I don't expect anything from you.
Do you like cheeseburgers?
She sat next to me.
I hope this is resolved quickly.
I would like it if we could spend more time together.
You won everything.
I'm not too old to do that.
This'll only take a moment.
You're very upset.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
Why don't you tell me how you think it happened?
The letter was written by Tom.
Tom was arrested last year.
Will you stay here for a while?
What if he doesn't want to talk to me?
They're going to the war.
Tom never breaks promises.
I think it's time for us to come to an agreement.
Tom sat on a stool in the corner.
Are you sure this is the right way to do it?
I don't like to sing in French.
There's no point in asking me for money.
Why is the light on?
There's no salt left.
You're pathetic.
There you are.
He kept on reading the book.
Tom and Mary are getting married tomorrow.
I was extremely angry.
I feel terrible about that.
Would you mind turning down the radio?
I'd like to speak with you.
This is awesome.
There is a long wait between trains.
I was the only one not invited to the party.
I'm getting old.
He did his best to be in time for the train.
I've got a funny feeling about that guy.
You've got to be bold!
You look very good.
I was looking for my diary.
What were we supposed to do?
They can add something if they wish.
I can put things in a box.
America's foreign debt shot past $500 billion.
I wonder what I should make for dinner.
What a fool I've been!
Tom is obviously very good at what he does.
He said he had been to Hawaii before.
I'll be there in a minute.
You're not dressed.
I thought you'd be grateful.
Dry the pants on the radiator.
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.
You don't have to hurry.
What exactly went on here last night?
I thought I was too young.
Do you remember the time we went to Paris?
Tom wanted to see Mary's room.
Which one of those is yours?
I met him by accident at the airport yesterday.
I'm not afraid of spiders.
The teacher pointed to the blackboard.
I went to Europe before the war.
I belong to the swimming club.
I'd like to tell you something in private.
I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
I appreciate your efforts.
That's so hard.
Try this instead.
Tom didn't want to listen to reason.
We're celebrating.
She was captured trying to steal jewelry.
She allowed me to go.
You and I are the same age.
I'm not that worried.
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee and topped off his own.
I think we may have something that you'd be interested in buying.
I love to go to the movies.
I'm coming right away.
Does he still have that book he borrowed from the library?
He died of a heart attack.
He did it out of kindness.
I don't know who won.
I don't like to talk about Tom.
What do you want to change?
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
I'm sorry that I've made you so unhappy.
You're precise.
Where did you find this ring?
How is life treating you?
I didn't know that this was the first time you kissed a girl.
The monks are meditating.
Tom thinks Mary is lying.
I love this store.
Why did you open the box?
Let's go back to the beginning.
She's pregnant.
How do you stand this cold?
What is he after?
We all like him.
Are you actually serious?
We import grain from the United States.
I'm not totally convinced of that.
Quote me an example.
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
I would prefer to speak to you in private.
How does it feel to be back?
I haven't finished reading the report.
We estimate the damage at one thousand dollars.
Is it an emergency?
We're not proud of it.
I talked to her.
Do you think you could do that again?
Which one of those is yours?
You look kind of pale.
Why didn't you say it like that?
It wasn't my fault.
I suggest that you take a nap.
Thousands of people there were arrested.
You can come home.
How could I forget?
I wish I could see you.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
Have you ever been betrayed by a friend?
It's better to err on the side of caution.
What is it you have against Tom?
Our passports were all we needed.
Blow out all the candles on the birthday cake at once.
Do you think Tom knows?
I can show you a better time.
People around the world are getting fatter.
Tom appeared to be in his early thirties.
He served his king faithfully.
I'm too tired to work.
He hurried so he wouldn't miss the train.
Tom drinks coffee.
Tom tends to only do what he's told to do.
She's married to a foreigner.
The plane landed without a problem.
Tom registered to become an organ donor.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
My daugther wants a kitten.
It's very cold.
They tried to swim to safety.
There were no mistakes.
I'm not like you.
We have no time to lose.
Tom is claustrophobic.
This airplane is capable of carrying 40 passengers at a time.
Something is wrong with the engine.
He likes being surrounded by young people.
What has become of your sister?
Most children love ice cream.
Eat whatever food you like.
I can barely pay my rent.
I didn't even notice you.
Don't you want some ice cream?
I'm a big fan of golf.
I'm looking for a sweater.
I just want answers.
I feel more alert after drinking a cup of coffee.
I'm a stranger here.
Can I have some of these?
It's a weapon.
I'm sorry. I'm a stranger around here.
The sun is shining brightly.
Do you have a cellphone?
We're going to go into the other room.
I could use some advice.
It makes me so happy.
Do you agree?
Tom and Mary are asleep.
Open the windows.
Do you really think Tom is ready?
Let's take that chance.
Try to think of something else.
I've been saving up to buy a new saxophone.
I think the story is true.
They were very hungry.
I can't believe you lied to me.
You two have a lot in common.
I advise you to be punctual.
Are you trying to kill me?
Come home before dark.
A sponge absorbs liquids.
I'm unarmed.
What are we eating for lunch today?
Many plants bloom in the spring.
I never thought Tom would follow me here.
I forgot to ask Tom.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Would you like a little help?
We've still got a long way to go.
He lost his ticket for the movie.
How can you concentrate?
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
Are you sure you're not tired?
No one's injured.
Tom tried to appear calm.
We've got plenty of time.
I was very nervous.
Somebody saw you.
How much did they give you for your old car?
They relaxed on the beach.
No one can help.
I think you did the right thing.
I'd like to change clothes.
I heard a voice I didn't recognize.
Tell me which you want.
People can't do a lot of things at the same time.
My husband is a good man.
What happened to my car?
I think we may have met somewhere before.
He went on reading the book as if nothing had happened.
We have more to do.
You look positively ghastly.
Why did you buy a flower?
Is that illegal?
This hurts more than you can imagine.
I just want to be your friend.
She bought him some candy.
Some people think that there are way too many lawyers in this country.
That's not even the worst part.
They're constructing a bridge over the river.
Tom and Mary are both very hungry.
He had his hair cut.
It seems to be a good house.
What would Tom do if he ever learned the truth?
Who was that?
Each of the three boys won a prize.
He used to read a lot.
I was aching from the injury.
I haven't eaten for many days.
I'm crazy.
He was brave.
No one seems afraid.
What do you desire?
She invited me to her home.
Did you see it?
You have been busy.
I asked Tom to go to the supermarket and buy some bread.
You really should buy a new car.
How long have you been out of prison?
I like to shop at that department store.
Is it OK to drink beer on your university campus?
I had a very good time.
You need to be more attentive in class.
I know what those books are like.
I'll be leaving now.
That's what everyone does.
I was really worried about you.
Can you pass me the potatoes?
I'm not convinced that you're telling the truth.
Where do the buses for downtown leave from?
He wants to squish the bug.
I lit the candle.
I know you want to make me happy.
America is often referred to as a melting pot.
Wait till the light turns green.
How can I make him stop?
I will give you this book.
Stop treating me like a child.
Have you met the person I hired?
Some of these are mine.
Who is their homeroom teacher?
I think we lost Tom.
I can't figure out how to solve this problem.
We're investigating it.
He wants something cold to drink.
They love this song.
He's a Republican fundraiser.
This time is no different.
I think you should reconsider this.
It's easier to spend a lot than to save a little.
I wish the rain would stop.
I didn't even get one letter from her.
What're you doing about this?
I just sent you a present in the mail.
This book is too large to go in my pocket.
Would you wait a second?
I thought Tom had a day off.
That's weird.
I was dismissed.
Are you still in love?
Let me handle this.
Are you a natural blonde?
Our investigation is ongoing.
I found it difficult to be kind to others.
I'm not giving you any money.
The mayor granted our request.
I sure wish you would leave.
Is he still interested?
I love this car.
I don't want Tom's death on my conscience.
No one's convinced.
I'd prefer to be at home.
Are you suggesting that we impersonate policemen?
I've already taken care of everything.
You'd be perfect for that.
I arrived yesterday.
My younger brother swims every day in the summer.
You said you needed someone to protect you.
I don't want to say that to my girlfriend.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I haven't left my room in three days.
You shouldn't have gone to visit Tom alone.
It's been a while since I've seen you.
You're twisting my words.
Tom died in the blast.
How could you be so cruel?
How long are you going to be seeing that loser of a boyfriend?
We left the movie early.
Tom is nuts.
She happened to know his address.
I see they've put you to work.
I'm going on a trip.
I fixed it.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
I'm the one that pays all the bills.
They received a box of books.
Why do they want to talk to me?
Let's go ask Tom.
I hardly ever get sick.
She made me cookies.
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a moment.
Tom often quarrels with his wife.
Tom will take care of this.
I think it's time for me to go back to work.
Tom never forgets anything.
I don't carry cash anymore.
Just say yes or no.
Don't worry about me so much.
You need to reboot your computer.
Someone broke my camera.
He was sentenced to community service.
May I bother you for a moment?
I could have been killed.
Here's what I'm doing.
Tom said that he regretted his decision.
That is very expensive!
You should be very proud of yourself.
I don't feel like celebrating.
Are you at home?
I can't count the number of times Tom has complained about that.
What if I told you I really want to be a teacher?
I want you to go see the nurse.
Tom treats me like a child.
We're out of time.
This looks like a good spot for fishing.
I don't want to discuss it.
Tom is listening to his iPod.
You look terrific.
You can work faster than that.
He won't talk to her and she won't talk to him.
I read that book several years ago.
Why don't people hibernate?
He beat the odds and was successful.
I'll show you the way to the station.
You don't have to stay in the hospital.
There isn't enough cake for everybody.
I'm not free to go this afternoon.
Let's not do anything stupid.
Where did you find this?
The charge for a front row seats is 5 dollars.
Tom's parents let him do what he wants to do.
I love this sweater.
I was happy to hear the news.
Do you know where the nearest American Express office is?
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I have a jealous husband.
They set the time and place of the wedding.
She reads the newspaper every morning.
I want you to run to the store for me.
I have a feeling he is right.
I understand your language.
We went to the park to take pictures.
Flattery will get you nowhere.
We have nothing to complain about.
Who's the last one?
Can't you ride a bicycle?
I don't shampoo my hair in the morning.
Where does he practice law?
Proper qualifications are required for the position.
He promoted the idea of world government.
Is this the bus to Oxford?
I'd rather stay.
I'm proud of you all.
His remark was really out of line.
He wasn't there last week.
I'll never understand you.
Can you make it safe?
Show me where it happened.
Tom was given a medal.
I put some milk in my coffee.
I hate being alone on Valentine's Day.
She smiled at him uneasily.
I need water.
My whole body is sore.
Circumstances have changed.
You must be very proud of your son.
What did I forget to say?
I would like to visit South Korea.
All of them are connected.
She kept me waiting for over an hour.
And everyone has the ability to contribute.
It's very rude of you to say a thing like that.
Are your parents in now?
Can you solve this problem?
I don't even know why.
He explained it to me.
That's more like it.
You look busy.
It's just as I hoped it would be.
I would appreciate a reply.
The negotiation is off.
How do you know how heavy it is?
The war began three years later.
What makes you think you won't be able to do it?
I finally gave up.
The hole is two meters across.
It's going to be a long winter.
I must work tonight.
I baked it for you.
I don't think it's a wolf.
All my friends like Tom.
A fuse has blown.
I thought you were a friend.
My best friend stole my boyfriend.
I want to be with you.
I should've read the instructions.
There is an urgent need for improved living conditions.
I haven't told Tom about that yet.
Tom showed me what he meant.
Do you really think it's no good?
I want to see your supervisor.
I let go of the rope.
My whole family is doing well.
This is rubbish.
She spoke up for him.
Take Tom outside.
Give me some time to let it all sink in.
You're very lonely.
When did the robbery happen?
Tom didn't know when Mary was planning to go to Boston.
I know who killed the police inspector.
Something very unusual seems to be happening in the park.
You're irresistible.
I hate traveling.
I don't know.
You'd better take care of it soon.
His data is often inaccurate.
What did Tom tell you about that?
He banged his head.
I support you one hundred percent.
I know that Tom is a creep.
Tom is a real nerd.
Nothing is more valuable than health.
I'll expect you next week.
Let's not waste our money.
Did you make any new friends?
We were all shocked.
Have you seen our museums? What do you think about them?
Let's talk about what happened yesterday.
You have to tell me the truth.
What do you like to eat most?
I fell off the ladder.
Have you already done that?
I forgot you didn't like pizza.
Which TV show do you like the most?
I received a letter written in English.
He broke into a house.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
I want to stay.
We'll be here all day.
All of us are getting older.
Osaka is the second largest city of Japan.
I think it's a bad idea.
I am out of time.
I kind of expected you to come alone.
I apologize for that.
Her oldest daughter got married.
I love the sound of rain on the roof.
He was given the sack.
Let's discuss the matter later.
Are you freaking out?
I wanted to get my mind off work.
I wish he were on our team.
Did you see a bag here?
This is an old Scottish song.
I like to dress this way.
She achieved remarkable results.
Have you ever seen anything like that?
I really don't need any help.
How did you come to know her?
I get it.
The king is coming.
How did you get to know Mary?
I haven't felt this happy in a long time.
It was just a lucky guess.
Do you enjoy living like this?
Something's wrong with the dishwasher.
No one knows what happened.
He ratted us out.
Long hair is out of fashion now.
I had a horrible childhood.
It's a very serious question.
There's so much I want to say to you.
Tom didn't know where Mary had gone skiing.
I thought you didn't like them.
They are about to start.
Is this some kind of joke?
How do you want your hair cut?
Aren't you going to say something?
Why don't you ask me what you really want to know?
We must execute his orders.
Dolphins are curious.
I didn't understand what the writer was trying to say.
I knew you'd have a good time.
There's a garden in front of our house.
I saw the figure of a man.
I was humiliated.
There's a secret passage.
This is all rubbish.
Can you give me Tom's address?
I had no visitors today.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
Come whenever you like.
They look happy.
Roses smell good.
You just don't know how it feels.
He stood against the wall.
I was stupid.
Tom gave me this apple.
Tom won't let Mary do anything she wants to do.
Have fun in Boston.
I am quite all right now.
I want you to stop doing that.
Why are you alone?
Can anyone help?
He repeated his name slowly.
Tom opened the safe.
The car crashed into the truck.
She's going to have a baby.
He does not take care of his children.
How much is the rent?
I was in the hospital for a week.
I'll take care of the horses.
Have you asked the others?
Tom was hiding behind a tree.
What is our plan?
I just want Tom to leave me alone.
He did nothing but cry.
I'd love to hold you in my arms.
Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to watch her son growing up.
Does anybody have a can opener?
The summer vacation is over.
He hung up.
I like Tom because he's honest.
Tom took a selfie and sent it to Mary.
I think Tom needs to go.
I just don't fit in anymore.
There's a way to do it.
I feel really strongly about it.
I hate these new boots.
Tom sealed the envelope.
I hung my coat in the hall closet.
I'm thinking.
Bad weather is no obstacle.
I didn't flunk.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
We just can't stand each other.
I don't think that she will come.
Haven't you said too much?
I haven't sold one of those in weeks.
You should have told me about the problem sooner.
What are you doing tomorrow?
I love shopping in this mall.
No money was stolen.
His birthday is August 21st.
Nonstop flights are almost always more expensive.
I just want my past to go away.
Have you read this book?
Is Tom related to Mary?
She's a smart and independent girl.
We can't tolerate that kind of behavior.
Tom went fishing.
Tom and Mary adopted a handicapped child.
I figured it out by myself.
My hair is too long.
Tom doesn't understand this.
It's really infuriating.
Sing us a song.
Let's take a short cut.
Are you for or against my plan?
They are my friends.
Has he given up cigarettes?
I don't care for wine.
She was the last person I expected to see in such a place.
You deserve a medal.
We're friends now.
I don't care what you think.
I don't see why not.
I can't feel it.
Life isn't all roses and sunshine.
I'm very happy to see you again.
How much are you being paid to do this?
I want you.
Tom told me he was really busy.
It all depends on the weather.
Whose is this bag?
Did you stay home to study for the test?
I'm still not sure.
I should've gone there with you.
I would never make fun of you.
Are you out of your mind?
She married a local boy.
Don't let your feelings show.
Why didn't you say it like that?
Tom was normally very reliable and his absence from the meeting was inexplicable.
I have a hunch that it will rain.
I'm a lot more comfortable now.
Why are you asking this?
I bought an old lamp.
Be careful near the edge of the cliff.
Who ate the bread?
That's really awesome.
I'll never ask you this question again.
I've never thought about giving up.
Where did you get all these?
I need another drink.
We would move to a bigger house if we had more money.
I wanted to fight.
I was speaking to you.
You are very early this morning.
That's why I have to do this.
Tom will spend Christmas Eve with his family.
I know something's going on.
I don't speak French very much.
He was proud of his daughter.
I know that I can count on you.
I often forget to brush my teeth.
Aren't you too young to smoke?
That child wants a friend to play with.
I need to wash my hands.
He was leaning against the wall.
Why did God create the universe?
He's agreed to do the job.
That job bores me to death.
I know Tom was shaken.
What did you think of that book?
Anybody want a lift?
I want a notebook.
She struggled to get up.
You've been warned.
I'd like to speak to the manager.
He bragged about it.
I wonder if he can reserve the flight for me.
He hasn't been doing anything since he graduated from high school.
Don't put words in my mouth.
Tom went running.
You should find a more constructive way of venting your anger.
I have a request to make.
I like the color blue.
It isn't too late to do the right thing.
Turn the volume up.
There's no need for that kind of behavior.
He was very scared when he saw this big snake.
I felt cheated.
Why don't we talk for a while?
It's all or nothing.
This is the worst book I've ever read.
May I interrupt?
Give me an example.
Let me grab my bag.
I've kept a diary for three years.
I disobeyed you.
He landed himself a really plum job.
I have been a teacher for 15 years.
He got tired of reading.
A very unfortunate case came to our attention several years ago.
Clean out the shed and throw away things you don't need.
I didn't think that you'd noticed.
None of them know French.
You are naughty.
Tom is sad.
Please be kind to others.
Tom's computer was in his car.
I'm smoking a Cuban cigar.
Am I the only one that agrees with you?
We're so glad to have you here.
The risk is too great.
You didn't understand me.
She avoided answering my questions.
I've always wanted to be a mother.
Look at that red building.
When were you born?
Throw the dice.
I liked your friends.
What do you have to do now?
Bring your brother with you.
I prefer black.
I figured I might find you here.
He got dressed and went outside.
Where are your suitcases?
They'll be ready for that.
Tom forgot to feed his dog.
We have to make sure that we never do this again.
I've never asked you for anything.
A female friend of mine loves to go to gay bars with me.
They had different ideas.
It's really awesome.
The concert was successful.
I'll call you after lunch.
The girl is reading with her grandfather.
We're very grateful.
I hope you found everything you need.
Tom said that he thought that pair of shoes were too expensive.
Does Tom like to swim?
This desk takes up too much room.
It was a pretty amazing experience.
I see your point.
Do you really believe I did that?
It's quite spectacular.
I had a nice long chat with my girlfriend's father.
What do you like about him?
You're opportunistic.
It's a proven fact.
I want you to dance with me.
Don't worry. We'll get the money.
Tom is OK now.
You have a good memory.
He may have missed his usual bus.
Tom wants to stay.
Show me everything.
The job offer still stands.
I said he could go.
I'm proud to be your father.
Tom said he heard the gunshots.
I asked him not to drive fast.
I'm not prepared to do that yet.
They're so funny.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
I'm loaded.
You're not safe there.
I'm flabbergasted.
Do you remember what you were watching?
Wait'll you hear what happened today.
There must be some misunderstanding between us.
We heard screaming outside.
Things got out of hand.
God bless you!
His policies were too progressive.
I promise I'll pay you back the money that I owe you before the end of the month.
I'm sad.
We'll have to deal with it.
Tom has a tendency to exaggerate.
It was nice of you to show up.
That's important to know.
There's no one else here.
Each taxpayer has the right to know where his money goes.
I'm sure you're busy.
Don't be sorry.
I don't think that Tom can speak French.
Many of the workers died of hunger.
Who is this boy?
I can't tell if you're serious or not.
I can't tell you anything yet.
I stayed at home last Monday.
You're a mighty good feller.
The accident was due to his carelessness.
Come help me.
I can do this all day.
I want to hear you scream.
We need something a bit more subtle.
What do you feel like eating?
Tom can understand French better than Mary.
One man's medicine is another man's poison.
There are two cats sleeping on the bed.
Do you know what your kids are eating?
I am studying now.
I'm being patient.
How does it work?
I have a lot of friends to help me.
Am I allowed to use this?
Tom still hasn't found what he was looking for.
That's a very interesting theory.
I could get punished if I did that.
I advised him to give up smoking.
These dogs are big.
I know you're innocent.
That's idle talk.
I heard a funny noise.
Tom was obviously offended.
Many young people were present at the party.
We weren't given a choice.
The boy takes after his father.
I'm not happy.
You taught me a lot.
They were tired of waiting.
Tom died at home.
You're very forward.
Which are the best ones?
She obeys him.
Why don't you put your clothes back on?
I don't have to talk to you.
Don't you smell something burning in the kitchen?
Would you like to talk?
I've caught a cold.
Where were you for the whole afternoon?
What you've heard about me isn't true.
Tom has betrayed me.
He is the very man for the job.
Tom is there to help Mary.
Those colors go well together.
I still can't believe I'm going to be on your team.
My bedroom is crawling with spiders.
She volunteered to go to the meeting with him.
Do you hear me?
She has a special way of making bread.
I had to postpone my appointment.
I think that would really hurt.
I'm the one that pays all the bills.
That's all I can say at the moment.
I've got a new bike.
Twenty years already passed.
I just changed my password.
You can't go right now.
Cats can see in the dark.
She donated countless pieces to the museum.
We agreed on a price.
It's starting to get cold here.
They agree.
I can't tell you how to do that.
You've got the wrong person.
The earthquake triggered a powerful tsunami.
Tom told me he was interested.
She traveled around the world.
The man you saw in my office yesterday is from Belgium.
Crime is increasing.
We had a lot of rain last month.
Did you get my gift?
You're very stylish.
Nobody knows everything.
It was a difficult year for us.
She took advantage of my ignorance.
I was shocked to see this.
I usually get up at eight.
What is your plan?
Perhaps you are right.
Who hired you?
Do you come here often?
Be careful!
Tom held Mary in his arms.
I thought you'd be grateful.
Do you think that's a coincidence?
I haven't yet told Tom about that.
I'm studying in the library.
You seem to be a busy man.
The rumor quickly spread.
I received your message.
He demanded that his salary be increased.
I'll give you a call in the morning.
I can't explain the situation better than that.
I've got something to show you.
The power went out.
He's my half-brother.
I'm not bluffing.
He admired his friend's work.
I had to do my duty.
I'm cured.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I don't believe that.
He likes singing and dancing.
Be watchful.
Are we all going to die?
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
Tom came here to help me.
Did you drink a lot?
It is often necessary to depend upon others.
I'm not home.
Where is he?
You take the money.
You had better go.
We miss you.
How do you remember that?
I don't want to lose my job.
He sees everything in terms of money.
I really want you to quit.
The apricot trees are in full blossom.
Were you shot?
You must be more polite.
His proposal was worthless.
I know Tom is a good chef.
Nature is full of mysteries.
The baby smiled at me.
Don't you see what's happened?
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
Do you really think Tom is impartial?
